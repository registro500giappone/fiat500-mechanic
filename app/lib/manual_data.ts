1 :1 Description 
The 'New 500' two-cylinder aircooled engine operates on the four-stroke 'Otto Cycle' and is fitted directly to the transmission unit which incorporates the rear drive assembly as shown in FIG 1 :1 and FIG 1 :2. 
With the power unit fitted at the rear several advantages are obtained including better load distribution to the wheels when the vehicle is loaded, elimination of propeller shaft reducing the size of centre tunnel and better use of available space. 
The cylinder block comprises two cast iron cylinder barrels with cooling fins. The bottom of the cylinders fit into machined seats in the aluminium crankcase. 
The aluminium crankcase carries eight studs on which are located the two cylinder barrels with the aluminium cylinder head on the top. 
A two bush crankshaft of special cast iron is fitted into the lower half of the crankcase. The crankshaft is 
provided with a counterweight and is hollow to allow for lubrication. 
The steel connecting rods have thin wall bearing halves on the big-end, and bronze bushes in the small-end. The offset piston pin is of steel and retained in the piston by two circlips. 
Light alloy pistons are used and are of the taper-oval shaped type with a maximum diameter at the base of the skirt, along an axis perpendicular to the piston pin. Pistons are fitted with four rings as follows, one compression at the top, two standard oil scraper rings and one side slotted oil scraper ring. 
The one-piece aluminium cylinder head is finned to provide a larger cooling surface and carries the inlet and exhaust manifolds. 
The inlet passages merge into a single centralized flange onto which is mounted the carburetter. The exhaust passages run almost parallel to the axis of the engine.

FIG 1:1 Left side view of the power plant to suit 500 Sedan 
Mounted on the top of the cylinder head is the overhead valve rocker mechanism that is operated by a chain driven camshaft through tappets and vertical pushrods. 
The carburetter is of the downdraft type fitted with a starting device that is controlled by a lever on the central floor tunnel. A pleated paper element air cleaner and silencer is fitted to the carburetter air intake. A mechanical diaphragm type fuel pump operated from the camshaft by a pushrod, supplies petrol to the carburetter from a fuel tank located at the front of the vehicle. 
Engine lubrication is provided by a gear pump driven from the camshaft and mounted within the timing cover drawing oil from the engine sump. The oil is cleaned by a centrifugal filter situated at the rear end of the crankshaft and pressure is controlled by a valve mounted on the pump body. Crankcase ventilation is provided for through a rubber hose connected to the top of the rocker cover. 
The engine is cooled by air from a centrifugal blower mounted on the generator shaft and housed in a specially designed cowling conveying air to and around the engine. The air temperature is governed by a special thermostat fitted in the engine cowling.

1 :6 Cylinder head removal, servicing and replace ment 
Description: 
The aluminium cylinder head is finned to increase the cooling surface. Through bolts secure the head and the two cylinders to the crankcase. The valves are controlled by a camshaft through tappets, pushrods and rockers. The connection between the head and the crankcase is via five sleeves mounted directly between the head and crankcase, and these accommodate the pushrods, lubricating oil and passage for the crankcase gases. The cylinder head has been modified for the 110 F and later 120 engines as they now incorporate a heater safety device as described in Section 4:4.

head. Disconnect the two side exhaust manifolds. 
Note the spark plug HT cables locations and dis 
connect from spark plugs. 
2 Remove the rocker shaft pedestal- and lift away the rocker gear. Extract the pushrods, making a careful 
note of their location. Remove the cylinder head hold 
down nuts in the order shown in FIG 1 :44 and using a 
puller as shown in FIG 1 :9 lift off the head. 
Dismantling the cylinder head: 
1 Using Fiat valve spring compressor A.60084 or a uni 
versal spring compressor depress the valve spring as 
shown in FIG 1 :14 and lift out the cotters. Release the 
compressor and withdraw the lock cone, oil shield 
(inlet valve only) upper spring cup, valve spring and 
lower spring cup. Withdraw the valve from the under 
side of the head. 
2 Dismantle the remaining three valve assemblies as detailed above ensuring that all parts are kept in sets 
for correct reassembly. 
Inspection and servicing of the cylinder head : 
1 Remove all carbon deposits from the combustion 
chambers and valve ports using a rotary wire brush or a 
set of scrapers. 
2 Thoroughly clean the cylinder head and to test for dis 
tortion lightly coat the machined faces with 'Engineers 
Blue' or lamp black and place the cylinder head on a 
surface plate. Carefully slide to and fro and any streaks 
left behind will indicate a distorted surface. A distorted 
head will not make a gas-tight seal with the cylinders 
and must be entrusted to an expert for correction or, 
in severe cases, renewed. 
3 Carefully clean the valve guides as shown in FIG 1:16 using Fiat guide brush A.11417 bis. Should the guides 
18 
Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine
be worn then they should be removed using a press and a suitable sized drift. The guides are press fitted with a pinch fit of .00134 to .00244 inch. To install the guides use Fiat tool A.601 53 as shown in FIG 1 :17. As the guides have no stop ring during the press fitting, the depth of insertion is determined by the Fiat tool. If the tool is not available take the necessary depth measure ments before the old guides are removed. The normal fit clearance between valve stem and guide is .00087 to .00217 inch with a maximum wear limit of .0059 inch. To check this see FIG 1:18. 
4 The valve seats should always be reconditioned after decarbonization. It is suggested that this operation be left to a local service station with valve seat cutting equipment. The valve seat angle for both inlet and exhaust valves is 45° ± 5'. 
5 Inspect the valves for soundness or distortion and if the clearance between guide and stem is within the manu facturers wear tolerance of .0049 inch the valve may be cleaned using a wire brush and the seating face ground to an angle of 45°30' ± 5'. This again should be left to the local service station. 
Valve springs: 
Thoroughly clean the valve springs of oil deposit and inspect for cracks. It is advisable to check the free spring height and if this dimension differs from the original height, details of which are given in Technical Data, the spring must be renewed. Any decrease in length indicates that the spring has weakened. 
Reassembly of the cylinder head: 
Reassembly is the reverse procedure to dismantling. During assembly utmost cleanliness must be observed as any abrasive material could find its way to the pistons and cylinder bores causing unnecessary wear. Check that the cylinder barrel mating face is clean to ensure correct gasket sealing. 

Cylinder head installation: 
To refit the cylinder head proceed as follows: 

1 
Place a new cylinder head joint on the cleaned faces of the cylinder barrels. Insert the rocker pushrod and lubrication pipe sleeves together with the relevant gaskets and rings. 
2 
Fit the washers and nuts to the studs and tighten to fingertight. 
3 
Tighten the nuts in the order shown in FIG 1 :44 and FIG 1 :46 to a torque wrench setting of 18.1 Ibft. Reset the torque wrench to a new setting of 23.9 Ibft and tighten the nuts once more in the recommended order. Replace the pushrods in the correct order. 
4 
Refit the rocker shaft ensuring correct location of the lubrication tube to the rocker shaft and replace the plain and lockwashers. Tighten the nuts to a torque wrench setting of 15.2 Ibft. Reset the tappet to rocker clearance adjustment. 
5 
Connect the two exhaust side manifolds to the cylinder head. Using new gasket refit the spark plugs and HT cables. Replace the rocker cover fitted with a new cork gasket and blower conveyor to the cylinder head securing screws. Refit the carburetter and reconnect its fuel line and controls. Refit the air cleaner and elbow and connect the rocker cover breather pipe (if fitted). 
FIG 1:19 Camshaft. The arrow points to the lube oil outlet port 
1 :7 Timing gear overhaul 
Camshaft: 
The cast iron camshaft is located in the crankcase and is supported at either end in sets machined directly in the crankcase. No bushes are used. The camshaft is driven by a chain from the crankshaft at half engine speed and operates the overhead valves through tappets, pushrods and rockers (see FIG 1 :20). 
During engine overhaul the camshaft journals and cam faces should be free of score marks or signs of seizure and have a bright mirror finish. 
The distributor drive gear should be inspected for tooth wear which if excessive means that the camshaft must be replaced. 
Tappets: 
The tappets should be inspected for signs of seizure or excessive wear. The end surface that is in contact with the camshaft should be smooth without signs of excessive wear. Any slight scratches or indentations may be removed using a very fine oil stone. 
Pushrods and sleeves: 
The pushrods operate in special axially resilient sleeves that are compressed on assembly between the cylinder head and the crankcase. It is through these sleeves that the engine sump is vented also through which the oil returning from the cylinder head passes. 
Two rubber O-ring seals are fitted to each sleeve to ensure an oil tight seal between the cylinder head and crankcase. The sleeves should be checked for distortion and exact equal length and when refitting new seals must always be fitted. 
The pushrods should be checked for straightness and the two ends that contact the rocker setscrew and the

tappet seat must not show any signs of roughness or excessive wear. 
Rocker and rocker shaft: 
During valve gear overhauls the clearance between the rocker shaft bore and the rocker must be checked. The maximum permissable wear between these two parts is .0059 inch. It is recommended that the part which is most worn be renewed, or in extreme cases both parts. 
1 :8 Crankcase and cylinders

The cast iron cylinders are finned radially to increase the 
cooling air surface and are located symmetrically on the 
crankcase, each being held by four studs. The cylinders are 
installed by sliding into the crankcase bores and finally 
held in place by the cylinder head (see FIGS 1 :8 and 
1 :21). 
Inspect the cylinder bores for score marks, wear and 
any other defects or damage. The clearance between the 
piston maximum diameter and the cylinder bore should be 
checked to ensure that it is within the maximum wear limit 
of .0059 inch.

Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine
It is essential that the diameter measurements are taken at two different heights in the cylinder bore along both the longitudinal and transverse axles as shown in FIG 1 :22. It is recommended that to zero the internal micrometer Fiat ring gauge C.672 is used (see FIG 1 :23). 
If bore wear or ovality is between .0059 and .0079 inch the cylinder bore may be honed. Should however the wear limit of .0079 inch be exceeded then the bores must be recut. 
Honing or reboring cylinder bores: 
This operation should bring the bore size to correspond to the oversize piston sizes in order to obtain the correct clearance between the piston and cylinder. These limits are given in Technical Data. It will be observed that the cylinders are divided into three classes depending on the bore diameter. The classes are identified by the letters 'A', 'B1 and 'C, one of which will be stamped on the mating face with the cylinder head as shown in FIG 1 :21. Pistons are divided into three classes to correspond with the cylinder bore sizes. Naturally the piston and bore must belong to the same class. The maximum available piston oversize is .0236 inch. 
Pistons and rings for the Model 500 sports engine are not available in oversize dimensions so if the cylinder bore diameter is above the maximum wear limit new parts must be fitted. 
Checking cylinder height: 
The cylinder height must be checked between the seat ing face on the crankcase and the top surface and this dimension should be 3.5433 ±0 0 0 6 inch. 
If this dimension is less than specified the cylinder must be renewed to prevent possible carbon deposits on the piston crown and underside of combustion chamber causing the piston to strike the cylinder head (see FIG 1 :24). 
DIAL GAUGE C 687

FIG 1 :23 Checking cylinder diameter by dial gauge C.687 brought to zero with ring gauge C.672 
Insert a .0079 ± .00197 inch thick oil paper gasket between the crankcase and cylinder bottom face and a .0236 to .0275 inch thick graphitized asbestos gasket between the cylinder and cylinder head. The compression of the gaskets on assembly will eliminate any very small differences between the two mating surfaces. 
Inspection of tappet seats: 
The tappet seats should be checked for scoring and correct clearance which must not exceed .00315 inch. Should the clearance be greater than the maximum specified the seating may be reamed to oversize dimen sions as detailed in Technical Data. Tappets are avail able in .00197 and .00394 inch diameter oversize. 
1 :9 Piston assembly 
Inspection: 
Before inspection the pistons must be thoroughly cleaned and the ring grooves and piston head decarbo nized. Check for deep score marks and signs of distortion or fracture especially around the skirt and piston pin areas. Using a feeler gauge ensure that the piston clearances in the bore do not exceed a maximum of .0059 inch for the Model 500 engine and .0079 inch for the Model 500 sports engine (see FIG 1 :25). The measurements should be taken at the bottom of the skirt and square to the piston pin axis. 
Should the clearance be greater than the maximum permissible, the cylinders may be rebored and oversize pistons fitted to match them. Pistons are supplied in the following oversizes, .0079, .0157 and .0236 inch. It should be noted that oversize pistons and rings are not available for the Model 500 sports engine so if the piston to cylinder wall clearance is greater than the permissible maximum limit the cylinder and piston assembly must be renewed. 
The piston ring to groove clearance must be checked as shown in FIG 1 :26 and the ring gap when fitted as in FIG 1 :27. In both cases the readings should be compared with the piston data. Piston rings are available in the same oversize classes as the pistons. When installing piston rings the gap should be placed opposite to the piston expansion stops. Ensure that the ring gaps are scattered and not in a line. 
FIG 1:24 Checking cylinder head mating face for level Out-of-true should not exceed .00315 inch 
FEELER GAUGE C.316 
FIG 1:25 Using feeler gauge C.316 to check piston-to- cylinder wall clearance 
FIG 1 :26 Checking piston ring-to-land clearance 
Check that the fit between the piston pin and boss is a pinch fit. If excessive clearance is found the boss may be reamed and a .0079 inch diameter oversize piston pin fitted. The pin to bore pinch fit must be between .0000 to .0039 inch. At all times the pins should be installed only after the piston has been heated in hot water to a tempe rature of 80°C.

Place a piece of 'Plastigage type PG-1' along the full width of the bearing insert along the crankshaft longitudinal axis (see FIG 1 :30). Refit the bearing cap and tighten the nuts to a torque wrench setting of 23.9 Ib ft. Remove the bearing cap and upon inspection the 'Plastigage' will be found to have adhered to either the crankpin or bearing insert and will have developed a rectangular section. To determine the actual clearance between the crankpin and bearing insert compare the width of the flattened 'Plastigage' at its widest point with the graduations on the envelope as shown in FIG 1 : 3 1 .

Checking rod bearing inserts and crankpin jour nals: 
The big-end bearing halves are of the babbit lined thin wall type and must not be modified in any way. Should score marks or excessive wear be evident the bearing inserts must be renewed. It is recommended that if the bearing inserts are to be renewed due to wear the crank pins should be measured to see if regrinding is required. 
Before regrinding the crankpins they should be measured at the maximum point of wear to determine the class of bearing undersize to be fitted after regrinding the crankpins. Undersize bearing halves are available in the following sizes .01, .02, .03 and .04 inch. The correct bearing crankpin clearance is .00043 to .00240 inch and must be checked as detailed in the following section. 
Checking rod bearing insert to crankpin journal clearance: 
Before the crankshaft is installed into the engine after overhaul the clearance must be checked to ensure that it is within the manufacturers recommended limits. To check the clearance proceed as follows:

Ensure the bearing half to connecting rod surfaces are perfectly smooth and free of score marks. Under no circumstances may the bearing surface be reworked. Check that the bearing half inserts are properly seated, with the locating lugs fitting into their slots: this is essential to obtain correct bearing clearance. As the circumference of the bearing half is greater than the seats in connecting rod and cap the bearing must be fitted so that the projection at each end of the bearing half is equal. 
Thoroughly lubricate all parts and tighten the end cap nuts to a torque wrench setting of 23.9 Ib ft.

After the crankshaft has been reground it is important that all traces of swarf are removed by constant washing and then drying with a non-fluffy rag. 
The clearance between the main bearings and journals 
3 
must be checked before installing the crankshaft in the engine. It should also serve as a recheck after the crankshaft has been reground. 
Measure the maximum main bearing internal diameter and the minimum journal diameter using accurate measuring equipment. The clearance must not exceed .0039 inch otherwise the journals must be reground and undersize bearings fitted. 
Undersize bearings with .0394 inch stock on the internal diameter are also supplied unmounted. They must be press fitted in the supports, the recommended interference fit being .00039 to .00197 inch. After pressing the bearing into the support, a hole is drilled in the bearing in line with the location dowel hole in the support. The hole is finished with a suitable expanding reamer, such as Fiat U.0334, and the dowel pressed in, noting that the hollow dowel fits in the flywheel end 
support. 
The next stage is to heat the assembly in an oven or oil bath for a period of one hour at 150°C (302°F). When the assembly has cooled to room temperature, the bearing is reamed in a lathe to match the crankshaft journal size.

1:14 Lubrication, oil filter, relief valve 
Description : 
The engine is pressure lubricated through a gear type pump which is incorporated in the timing gear cover and driven from the camshaft by dogs or gears. The lubrication circuits are shown in FIGS 1 :36 and 1 : 37. 
The pump draws oil from the sump through a suction horn fitted with a filter screen which is fixed to the crank case by a duct in the timing gear cover. This supplies oil to the pump. 
Oil passes from the camshaft rear seat onto the crank shaft rear support where it flows into an adjacent chamber. From here the oil flows through ducts in the crankshaft from end to the centrifugal oil filter. The centrifugal filter, which also acts as a pulley for the generator and blower drive, rotates with the crankshaft. 
Oil from the filter enters a passage in the crankshaft, where it lubricates the main and connecting rod bearings and passes from a special groove in the front main bearing and ducting in the crankcase into which is inserted the oil pressure warning sender unit, and also the delivery pipe for oil to the overhead valve gear. 
The pushrod sleeves provide the return path for the oil from the cylinder head and delivers oil to the tappet gear and the camshaft cams. The tappets are suitably drilled to allow correct circulation of the oil. The tappets are located in two casting cavities, one of which com municates with the timing gear housing and the other one to the crankshaft front drain support drain. 
The oil pressure is regulated by a pressure relief valve 5 (see FIG 1 :38) mounted at the rear end of the camshaft. It comprises a hubbed disc which slides on a guide 6 of the oil pump drive shaft 7. Under spring load 9 the valve disc circumferentially closes an annular chamber which communicates with the lubrication circuit. Excessive oil pressure causes the disc to uncover the chamber. 
Centrifugal oil filter: 
The oil filter is of the centrifugal type comprising of two flanges and an oil slinger. The filter is attached to the rear end of the crankshaft as shown in FIG 1 :38. The outside diameter of the oil slinger (see FIG 1 :39) is smaller in diameter than that of the flanges but of such a

size that centrifugal force does not sling oil into the area where the foreign matter is collected. The outer flange inner face has radial vanes on its face which retain the foreign matter and the oil is conveyed to the centre of the filter. 
The oil to be filtered issues from the side splines 1 (see FIG 1 :40) of the crankshaft and is forced by the slinger to the periphery of the filter where it is cleaned and returns to the centre of the filter and into the crankshaft drilling 2. The inner flange or hub and the slinger are secured to the crankshaft by a special hollow screw 6 as shown in FIG 1 :39, the outer flange is attached to the hub by six screws. 
28 
Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine
A groove is machined on the outer flange periphery to form a pulley for the generator and blower drive belt. 
Cleaning and inspection: 
To ensure a reliable lubrication system there must be no oil leaks from the gasket between the outer and inner flanges. Every time the engine is overhauled the filter must be dismantled, cleaned and new gaskets fitted. To clean the filter, remove the six screws and washers and separate the drive pulley and hub. Carefully scrape the inner surfaces to remove all sludge. 
Upon reassembly the filter to crankshaft hollow mounting screws must be tightened to a torque wrench setting of 1 08.5 Ib ft. The cover to mounting flange screws must be tightened to a torque wrench setting of 5.8 Ibft. 
Oil pressure indicator sender unit: 
The oil pressure indicator sender unit is located on the righthand side of the cylinder block and is connected to an indicator light in the instrument cluster on the dash board. 
The red indicator lights only when the ignition is switched on and goes out when oil pressure has built up to between 8.5 and 14 Ib/sq in. 
Should an accidental shortcircuit occur in the oil pressure indicator circuit, the sender unit may be damaged so the cause must be traced and rectified before the unit is renewed. 
1:15 Valve timing 
If the camshaft has been disconnected from the crank shaft for any service operation the valve gear will have to be retimed and to do this proceed as follows: 1 Turn the crankshaft until the reference line on its 
sprocket is pointing towards the camshaft as shown in FIG 1 :41. 
2 Turn the camshaft until the reference dot on its sprocket registers with the crankshaft sprocket. Leave the shafts undisturbed and carefully mount the chain. Should it be necessary to check the valve timing and sprocket marks, proceed as follows: 
1 Fit Fiat C.673 tool as shown in FIG 1 :42. 2 Temporarily adjust the valve stem-to-rocker arm clearance of cylinder No. 1 at .01 77 inch for the inlet valve and .01 50 inch for the exhaust valve (Model 500 engine) or at .01 54 inch for both valves (Model 500 sports). 
3 Rotate the crankshaft and set the flywheel timing mark at 'O' on the graduated sector. Check that the sprocket marks are correctly lined up in this position. If the engine is being assembled, to install the driven gear, proceed as follows: 
1 Set the timing mark on the drive sprocket towards the centre of the camshaft. 
2 Position the driven sprocket on the camshaft mounting flange with four screw holes in line and tighten two mounting screws only. 
3 Rotate the camshaft until the driven sprocket mark registers with the reference line on the drive sprocket. 4 Remove the driven sprocket without moving the camshaft. Install the timing chain and replace the driven sprocket. Tighten the four screws to a torque wrench setting of 6.5 Ib ft. 
5 Using the graduated sector check that all the valve timing angles are as detailed in Technical Data. Readjust the valve stem to rocker arm clearance to the correct setting. 
1:16 Valve stem-to-rocker clearance adjustment 
It is important that the clearance between the valve stem and rocker is kept to the recommended figure of .0059 inch, measured when the engine is cold. 
If the clearance is excessive operating noise will occur and if less than recommended the valves will stay open too long which will result in damage to the valve face and its seating. 
Inspect the contacting surfaces for scoring or pitting: if it is excessive, new parts must be fitted. Also check the condition of the rocker-to-valve and rocker ball head-to-pushrod contact surfaces are free from wear or pitting. The faces must have a mirror finish. 
The oilway in the rockers and shaft must be thoroughly inspected and free from sludge, otherwise lubrication failure will occur. 
The assembly clearance between the rocker arm and shaft should be .00063 to .00217 inch and the clearance between the rocker shaft and the shaft support should be .00020 to .00138 inch with a maximum wear limit of 0039 inch. 
Turn the engine until the valves of one cylinder are in balance, that is, the inlet valve opening and the exhaust valve closing. The other cylinder will now have both valves fully closed. Adjust the valves on this second cylinder by loosening the locknut, and turning the adjuster as shown in FIG 1 : 43 to obtain the desired clearance measured with a feeler gauge. Adjust the clearances on the other cylinder in the same manner. 
1 :17 Engine assembly (sedan — all versions) To reassemble the engine proceed as follows: 1 Thoroughly clean and dry all the parts, ensure that all drillings are free from dirt or sludge and place on a clean dry surface. 
2 Carefully install the cylinder-piston-connecting rod assemblies with new paper gaskets between the cylinders and crankcase seats. 
3 Refit the big-end bearing shells to the connecting rods, ensuring that they are free from any dirt or metallic particles. Carefully ease the crankshaft into the crankcase, lubricate the main journals with clean engine oil, place a new paper gasket between the supporting member and the flywheel end of the crankcase. Install the supporting member and bearing assemblies. Secure the supporting members with the screws and special toothed washers. 
4 Locate the connecting rod big-end half onto the crankpin journals, liberally lubricate the journals with fresh engine oil, fit the remaining shell half, matching bearing end cap and tighten the bearing cap nuts to a torque wrench setting of 23.9 Ib ft.

The combined power and transmission unit is elastic ally mounted on two supports. 
The front of the unit rests on a crossmember which is secured under the car floor through two rubber block mountings that are bolted to the gearbox casing as shown in FIG 1 :48. The position of the rubber blocks on the crossmember is adjustable so that the assembly can be correctly aligned. 
With the rear of the unit the engine crankcase is sprung to the body rear crossmember through an articulated swinging arm that compresses a coil spring as shown in FIGS 1 :47 and 1 :49. A rubber bump pad is mounted inside the spring to give a progressive action. 
Whenever the power and transmission unit is being serviced the condition of the mountings should be checked and any worn or damaged parts renewed. 
1 :20 Adjustment of generator and fan drive belt 
The centrifugal oil filter cover/pulley on the crankshaft transmits the drive through a V-belt to the generator and centrifugal fan pulley.

Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine
When the V-belt has been correctly adjusted the belt should sag 13/32 inch under a hand pressure of about 22 lb as shown in FIG 1 :49. 
Should the belt be too slack the generator and centrifugal fan will not operate at the correct speed causing overheating and a discharged battery. Also the belt will slip causing rapid wear of the belt. Conversely if the belt is too tight excessive loading will be placed on the generator bearings causing excessive bearing wear and noisy operation. 
To adjust the belt tension proceed as follows: 1 Remove the three nuts 'B' (see FIG 1 :49) on the generator pulley and this will split the pulley into two parts between which are spacer rings. 
2 The tension of the belt is increased or decreased by either reducing or increasing the number of spacers. 3 Place the spacer rings removed from between the pulley halves on the pulley outer face so that the rings 
may be re-inserted when fitting a new belt. 4 Tighten the three nuts to a torque wrench setting of 14.5 lb ft.

2:1 Description 
All the new 500 models use a mechanical diaphragm fuel feed pump as shown in FIG 2:1. Four types of carburetter are fitted depending on the model to which the engine is installed. Each carburetter operation and adjustment is fully described, together with details of the recirculation device for blow-by gases and oil vapours. 
2:2 Fuel pump operating principles 
Refer to FIG 2 :2. An eccentric on the rotating camshaft actuates the operating rocker 21 via a pushrod 25 which depresses the diaphragm 14 and so creates a depression in the pumping chamber located in upper body 5. Under atmospheric pressure, petrol passes through the pipeline connection and inlet valve into the pumping chamber. The return spring 15 then raises the diaphragm, expelling the petrol through the outlet valve and pipeline to the carburetter float chamber. 
When the float chamber is full, the pressure in the pipe line and pumping chamber holds the diaphragm depressed against the tension of the return spring.

2:3 Routine maintenance 
A poor delivery of fuel to the carburetter may be due to a fault in the fuel pump or related lines. Periodically the pump body screws 19 (see FIG 2:2) and upper cover screw 1 should be checked for tightness. The fuel pump lines should be disconnected and checked for freedom of restriction, chafing and loose connections. The fuel pump filter should be removed and cleaned periodically. 
2:4 Pump removal, dismantling and examination 
The pump is located on the carburetter side of the engine crankcase (sedan) or under the generator at the front of the crankcase (station wagon). 
Removal: 
1 Disconnect the fuel pipe from the tank to stop petrol syphoning out of the tank and then release the fuel inlet and outlet pipes from the pump body. 
2 Remove the two nuts and washers holding pump to crankcase. 
3 Carefully lift away the pump, gaskets and insulating pad from the crankcase (see FIG 2:3).

Dismantling: 
1 Refer to FIG 2:2 and remove the cover mounting screw 1 and washer 2. Lift off cover 4 and filter 13. Mark the relative position of the two halves of the pump body. Remove the pump bodies interlocking screws 19 and separate the upper half from the lower half of the body. 
2 Push down the centre of the diaphragm assembly 14 and rotate through 90 deg. to release diaphragm from the rocker 21. Lift out diaphragm and spring 15. 
3 Release the two valve assemblies in the upper body by removing the valve retaining plate locking screws 11, and lifting out the plate 12, gasket 10, valve springs 6 and 9, and valves 7 and 8. 
4 Using a pin punch remove the rocker pivot pin together with the two washers and carefully lift away rocker and reaction spring. 
5 Thoroughly wash all components in petrol and blow dry with compressed air or a foot pump. Inspect the valves 7 and 8 for evidence of damage and valve springs 6 and 9 for weakness or cracks. Check to see that the diaphragm reaction spring and rocker are not distorted or unserviceable. Generally inspect all parts for cracks, distortion and the diaphragm for stiffness and also the rocker and pin for wear. 
2:5 Reassembly, installation and adjustment 
Ensure that all parts are clean and dry. Assembling is the reverse procedure of dismantling. Lubricate the rocker lever and pin before placing them in the lower body. 
Installation: 
Carefully slide the pump control pushrod into the crankcase, assemble the two gaskets with the insulating pad in between and slide over the pump retaining studs. Ease the pump towards the crankcase ensuring the push rod locates correctly in the rocker end. Finally tighten the two retaining nuts and spring washers.

design with a 1.0236 inch diameter throat measured at the height of the throttle shaft. The amount of charge passing to the manifold is controlled by a throttle butterfly valve from an accelerator pedal operating a lever secured to the throttle valve shaft via a cable. The carburetter is fitted with a progressive action starting device which enables the driver to suit the mixture richness to the most arduous of starting conditions, and will enable the engine to run evenly until it reaches its normal operating temperature. 
A dampened needle valve ensures a smooth running engine as it is not affected by engine vibrations and there fore giving a constant fuel level in the carburetter bowl. A secondary venturi is incorporated in the single casting of the carburetter body and this has a diameter of 0.8268 inch. 
Carburetter operation: 
Filtered air flows through the venturi 24 (see FIG 2 :4) where it mixes with fuel flowing from the nozzle 25 and the charge is then conveyed to the cylinders through the primary venturi 21 and throat, where the throttle butterfly 19 controls the amount of charge. 
Petrol flows from the main fuel line to the bowl 16 through a gauze filter 7 and needle valve 10, where the float 12 pivoting at point 11, controls the opening of the needle 10 so maintaining a constant fuel level. From the bowl 16 fuel reaches the emulsion well 23 via the metered main jet 15 where, after having been mixed with the air coming from the metered air corrector screw 1, through the emulsion orifices 22 and spray nozzle 25, it finally reaches the Venturis where it mixes with the air stream

caused by the engine suction and the charge is then drawn into the cylinders. 
The secondary venturi 24 is to increase the vacuum 
around the nozzle 25 and to carry the charge to the centre of the primary venturi 21. 
When the engine is idling, fuel is carried from the well 
23 via an appropriate passage to the idle speed jet 13 where it is mixed with the air coming from the air inlet 5. Through duct 3 and idle speed orifice 18 (adjustable by means of a taper point screw 17), the fuel reaches the carburetter throat, past throttle butterfly 19 where it is further mixed with the air stream drawn in by the engine vacuum through the gap around the throttle in the idling speed position. 
From the duct 3 the mixture can also reach the car 
buretter throttle chamber through a transition hole 20 which is located in exact relation to the throttle butterfly. The purpose of this progression hole is to permit a smooth acceleration of the engine from the idling speed, this being proportional to the increase in the throttle opening. 
Starting device: 
This enables the engine to be started when it is cold 
under the most arduous of weather conditions. It is con trolled by means of a lever placed behind the gearshift lever and must be progressively adjusted to its normal rest position as the engine reaches the normal operating tem perature. The starting device comprises a valve 33 (see FIG 2:5) actuated by the lug of the rocker 36 which is connected to the control lever 38 by a suitable shaft. By 
38 
Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine
pulling the device control fully across through lever 38 and rocker 36, the valve 33 is lifted from its seating and brought into the 'fully open' position. Refer to diagram 'A' (FIG 2:5). Under these conditions the valve 33 closes the air hole 27 and the mixture hole 29 and uncovers mixture orifices 30 and 32 which also communicate with the starting jet 46 through a duct 26 and air holes 35. With the valve 33 partially open the hole 29 may com municate with the carburetter throat through the valve central slot, duct 28 and the hole 31 drilled in the venturi 21 corresponding with the venturi restriction. 
When the throttle is set at the idling speed position, the engine vacuum caused by the operation of the starter enables the fuel contained in the recess of jet 46, in the jet and in the reserve well 45 to be mixed with the air coming from holes 43 and 44. The mixture arrives through the duct 26 and holes 30 and 32, at the same time as air passing from the holes 35, past the throttle through duct 34 so permitting easy starting of the engine. 
After the engine has fired initially, the device will deliver a charge with a rich petrol/air ratio so as to permit regular running of the engine whilst it is cold. As soon as the 
engine has warmed up to normal operating temperature this charge would obviously be too rich and therefore it is necessary to gradually ease off the operation of the starting device as the engine reaches its normal operating tempera ture. During this adjustment the valve 43 slowly uncovers the hole 27 which will permit a greater amount of air to enter through the spring guide hole 42 so weakening the mixture at the same time as closing the progression holes 30 and 32 and air holes 35 the amount of mixture is also reduced. See diagram 'B' (FIG 2:5). 
The hole 29, the duct 28 and the hole 31, which are drilled in the venturi 21 permit a regular progression of acceleration whilst the engine is cold as well as when it is at normal operating temperature. By opening the throttle butterfly 19 to increase the speed of the engine the vacuum acting on the duct 34 is decreased. This causes a drop in the amount of fuel delivered through duct 34 with consequent irregular running of the engine but, through hole 31, duct 28 and hole 29 some charge is sucked in by the vacuum formed in the restriction of the venturi, caused by the opening of the throttle and this automatically com pensates for the reduction in the delivery through the duct 34. 
When the starting device is not in operation, valve 33 covers the hole 29 and so preventing the passing of fresh charge. Diagram 'C (FIG 2:5). 
Engine starting: 
So that full advantage may be taken of the progressive action starting device the engine should be started as follows: 
1 Cold starts: 
The starting device should be moved across the position 'A', (FIG 2:6). Once the engine has fired push the control in partially. 
2 Warm starts: 
Only partially move the starting device as shown in position 'B' (FIG 2:6). 
3 Engine warm-up: 
As the engine begins to warm up to its normal operating temperature, gradually push home the starting device lever so as only to supply the engine with the richened charge enabling the cold engine operation to be smooth and regular. Position 'B' (FIG 2:6). 
4 Normal car driving: 
Once the engine has reached its normal operating temperature the starting device should be completely brought out of operation by bringing the control lever to the position 'C (FIG 2:6). 
Idle speed adjustment: 
The idling speed of the engine is adjusted by means of a throttle setscrew and the mixture setscrew, the position of which are shown in FIG 2:7. The throttle screw allows for the adjustment of the throttle butterfly opening, the coni cal mixture setscrew meters the amount of charge issuing from the idling speed passage which causes the mixture to blend with the air flowing past the throttle that leaves a gap between its edges and the throat walls. This ensures a correct petrol/air mixture ratio best suited to the engine requirements giving smooth operation. 
The engine idling speed must always be adjusted when the engine is at its normal operating temperature and then setting the throttle butterfly position to its minimum open ing position by adjusting the throttle setscrew so giving a steady engine speed. Turn the mixture screw in or out so as to set the mixture richness to the most suitable ratio for the selected throttle opening. This will accomplish a fast but steady idling. Reduce the minimum throttle opening slightly by adjusting the throttle setscrew until the best idling speed is obtained. 
Adjustment of fuel level in float chamber: 
The needle valve, seating and float are easily accessible for inspection by removing the carburetter top cover. Before checking the petrol level in the float chamber, ensure that the needle valve seat is screwed well home and that the gasket is in place. Also check that the calibrated orifice in the valve seat is unobstructed and not worn and finally check that the needle slides freely in its guide. Should the valve and seating be leaking, then the valve assembly must be renewed. Check that the float is not distorted or punc tured and that it moves on its pivot without resistance or excessive play. Again renew the float assembly if there is any doubt. To check the level proceed as follows: 
1 Check that the needle valve 3 (see FIG 2 : 8) is screwed tight on its seat. 
2 Keep the carburetter cover 1 upright or else the weight of the float 9 will lower the ball 8 fitted on the needle 4. Check that with the cover held in the vertical position and the float arm 6 in slight contact with the ball 8 of the needle 4, the float is 5/16 inch away from the cover with its gasket 2 fitted flat against the cover face. 
3 Check that the float travel is 5/16 inch and if necessary bend the lug 5 to give the required settings. 4 If the float 9 is not correctly positioned, bend the float arms 7 until the correct adjustment is obtained. Ensure that the arm 6 is perpendicular to the needle axis and

Carburetter cleaning: 
To thoroughly clean the carburetter proceed as follows: 
1 Passages. All fuel passages have a diameter that is 
specially calibrated to ensure best operating conditions. 
It is therefore essential that any dirt or scale that has 
been deposited by petrol must be removed. Thoroughly 
clean with petrol and blow dry using a compressed air 
jet directed through all the passages in the castings. It is 
essential that no drills or other metal objects be passed 
through the jets or the passages otherwise these could 
alter the finely calibrated diameters. 
2 Calibrated parts. Idling and main jet holders, and the 
relevant bayonet coupled jets are easily removed by 
using a suitably sized wrench or screwdriver. To clean 
the different calibrated parts, thoroughly wash in petrol 
and blow dry using a compressed air jet. Do not use any 
fine drills or metallic points as these may alter the fine 
calibration of the orifices. Should it be necessary to dis 
mantle the carburetter adjustment components for

Throttle valve components: 
The throttle valve shaft should rotate freely in its guides 
and this should be checked when the engine is at its normal operating temperature. Any excessive clearance caused by wear or the throttle valve butterfly distorted are liable to cause irregular engine operation which will be more pronounced at idling speed. Should the above con ditions be evident then the throttle valve butterfly and the shaft assembly together with its sealing rings must be renewed.

inspection always ensure that after reassembly of the parts that they are seated correctly to avoid possible operating troubles in the future. 
3 Filter. To clean the filter unscrew and remove its plug 10 (see FIG 2 :9) located on the top of the carburetter cover and then gently ease out the filter. Wash the filter carefully in petrol, also ensure that the filter seat is clean and then blow dry using a compressed air jet. 
2:7 Modifications 
The Weber 26.IM B carburetter has undergone a number of minor changes during the development of the Fiat 500 models, but no changes in servicing procedure are made necessary. Jet sizes and other calibrations are detailed in Technical Data. 
From 1970, the mounting flange of the carburetter is slightly modified to incorporate a different mixture adjustment screw, as shown in FIG 2:11. 
FIG 2:12 illustrates the starting device fitted to 26.IMB.4 and later carburetters. It differs from earlier units in detail, principally in having fewer starting mixture orifices 30 and 32 into the mixture duct 26. 
2:8 Carburetter operation and adjustment, Weber 26. OC 
The new 500 station wagon is fitted with the Weber 26.OC carburetter which is of a horizontal draft design to suit the engine which is fitted in the horizontal position. The carburetter is fitted with a progressive action starting device which enables the driver to adjust the mixture rich ness to the most arduous of starting conditions, and will enable the engine to run eyenly until it reaches normal operating temperature. 
A dampened needle valve ensures a smooth running engine as it is not affected by engine vibrations and there fore giving a constant fuel level in the carburetter bowls. A secondary venturi is incorporated in the single casting of the carburetter body. 
Carburetter operation, starting device: 
The petrol from bowl 23 (see FIG 2:13) reaches the starting jet 37 through the duct 35. By operating the choke lever 31 to the end of its stroke, the valve 30 is lifted from its seat and brought to the 'fully open' position as shown in diagram 'A' (FIG 2:13). Under these conditions the valve 30 uncovers both the starting mixture ducts 28 and 29. With the throttle set in the idling speed position the engine vacuum created by the operation of the starter motor causes the fuel contained in the recess of jet 37 in the jet and the reserve well 36 to be mixed with the air coming from the air jet 38. 
The mixture arrives through the ducts 28 and 29 at the same time as air from holes 34, past the throttle so per mitting easy starting of the engine. 
FIG 2:11 Mounting flange modification: A earlier, B later (dimensions in mm) 
Once the engine has initially fired the starting device will deliver a mixture whose petrol/air ratio is such that the engine will run regularly even though it is cold. As soon as the engine warms up this rich charge would be excessive and therefore it becomes necessary to gradually ease back the operation of the starting device. As this is occurring, the valve 30 gradually covers up the mixture duct orifice 28 so as to weaken the mixture while by closing the duct 29 gradually. It also reduces the amount of mixture delivered by the carburetter as shown in diagram 'B' (FIG 2:13).

Idle speed adjustment: 
The idling speed is adjusted by movement of the throttle setscrew and the mixture setscrew. The throttle screw allows for the adjustment of the throttle opening whereas the conical mixture setscrew has the purpose of metering the amount of charge issuing from the idling speed pas sage, which will then mix with the air flowing past the throttle which when correctly set for normal idling speed should leave a gap between its edges and the throat walls. This ensures a correct petrol/air ratio best suited to the engine requirements and smooth operation. 
The idling speed should always be adjusted with the engine running and at its normal operating temperature 4. 
by first setting the throttle to its minimum opening by turning the throttle setscrew so enabling an accurate adjustment to be made. Then slowly turn the mixture set screw either in or out so as to adjust the mixture petrol/air 
3 
ratio to the most suitable for the throttle opening, this will accomplish a fast and steady idling speed which should be then reduced by closing the throttle opening slightly by 2 
easing back the throttle setscrew. This adjustment should continue until the best idling speed is obtained.

2:10 Blow-by-gases recirculation device Engine 110 F.000 
All the oil vapours and blow-by-gases that are formed in the engine crankcase are drawn to the cylinder head cover recess 1 (see FIG 2:18). From here they travel into the pipe 5 via a breather valve 2 which is firmly attached to the oil filler cap 3 and the strainer 4 located in the filler neck. The oil vapours and gases are then drawn back into the duct 9 from the pipe 5 which connects the air cleaner 6 to the carburetter 7. This ensures a complete closed cir cuit circulation. 
Engine 120.000: 
From engine No. 288156 the oil vapours and blow-by gases instead of being exhausted to the atmosphere are conveyed to the air cleaner and from here they are drawn back into the combustion chambers. To ensure that an excessive of oil vapour does not pass along the piping with the blow-by-gases a diaphragm is fitted in the duct in front of the breather valve 2 (see FIG 2 :18), the dia phragm comprising a filter gauze 11 and moveable parti tion 10. 
It should be noted that the oil vapour strainer 4 (see FIG 2:18) and the flame trap 8 can easily be removed from their seating for cleaning or renewal. 
2:11 Fuel tank

advisable for a garage to attend to this as it is very dange rous to apply heat to a petrol tank without first taking strict precautions and a garage will be in a better position to do this. To clean the tank interior, remove the drain plug and spray in a jet of air or petrol so that all sediment and dirt deposits can be loosened. Then vigorously shake the tank. Flush the tank with petrol and blow the tank dry. Repeat this procedure until the tank is clean. Refit the drain plug. 
Whilst the petrol tank is away from the car it is advisable to disconnect the fuel feed pipes at the pump and the carburetter and ensure that these are clear by using an air jet to one end of the pipe.

3 :1 Description 
The ignition system fitted to all the models covered by this manual consists of an ignition coil, ignition distributor fitted with contact breaker points, a centrifugal automatic advance system, condenser, low- and high-tension wiring, spark plugs and a power supply provided by a generator and battery. The wiring diagram is shown in FIG 3:1 
1 The low-tension circuit which is sometimes called the primary circuit includes the power supply, contact breaker points, condenser and ignition coil primary winding. 
2 The high-tension circuit which is sometimes called the secondary circuit includes the ignition coil secondary winding, distributor rotor, distributor cap with terminals and the central brush, high-tension cables and the spark plugs. 
3:2 Operation 
The contact breaker unit in the distributor interrupts the primary circuit by the points opening. The sudden stop in the flow of current in the primary winding, does not cause arcing at the contact breaker points because it discharges into the condenser connected in parallel with the contact 
breaker points. With the sudden collapse of the primary circuit, the intensity of the magnetic field drops causing an induced high-tension current in the ignition coil secondary winding. The high EMF is distributed to the sparking plugs by the ignition distributor rotor. 
The automatic advance mechanism comprises a plate carrying two weights which are symmetrically pivoted on the plate at one end. Also attached to the weights at opposite ends to the pivots is the cam carrier shaft with special tension return springs. Under the action of centri fugal force as the rotational speed increases, the weights move outwards causing the cam carrier shaft to move angularly compared to the distributor drive shaft thus causing advancement of the ignition timing. 
The contact breaker assembly comprises the cam on the drive shaft and two contact points, one of which is stationary while the other is under the influence of the cam, the action of which is transmitted by a rubbing block. The cam has two lobes to control the opening and closing of contact points. The stationary contact point is mounted on an adjustable support to enable the contact breaker point gap to be adjusted. 
The HT current reaches the distributor cap central terminal, from the ignition coil and is distributed to each of the spark plugs at the correct time by the rotor arm.

extent so that the gap is measured at the position of the maximum opening. Reset the gap to a correct clearance of .0185 to .0209 inch and tighten the contact carrier screw. 
Cleaning the contact points: 
If the contact points are dirty or pitted they must be cleaned by polishing them with a fine carborundum stone taking very great care to ensure that the contact faces are flat and square. Afterwards wipe away all dust with a cloth moistened in petrol. The contacts may be removed from the distributor body to assist refacing and cleaning refer ring to Section 3:5. If the moving contact is removed from its pivot, check that its operation is not sluggish. If it is

Refer to FIG 3: 2 and remove the distributor cap and lift 
off the rotor arm. Lubricate the cam spindle felt pad using Fiat VS oil. There is provision for the oil to make its way downwards. Squirt a few drops of oil into the distributor shaft lubrication fitting, the location being shown in FIG 3:3 Smear a little grease on the cam and a small drop of oil to the contact breaker point pivot. 
Adjusting the contact breaker points: 
Refer to FIG 3:2 and slacken the stationary contact

tight, polish the pivot pin with a strip of fine emery cloth, clean off all dust and apply a tiny spot of oil to the top of the pivot pin. If a spring testing gauge is available the contact breaker spring should have a tension of 16.8± 1.8 oz. measured at the points. 
3 :4 Ignition faults 
If the engine runs unevenly set it to idle at a fast speed. Taking care not to touch any metal part of the sparking plug leads, pull up the insulator sleeve and short each plug in turn, using a screwdriver with an insulated handle. Connect the screwdriver blade between the plug top and the cylinder head. Shorting a plug which is firing properly will make the engine uneven running more pronounced. Shorting a plug in a cylinder which is not firing will make no difference. 
Having located the faulty cylinder, stop the engine and remove the plug lead. Start the engine and hold the lead carefully to avoid shocks so that the metal end is about 3/16 inch away from the cylinder head. A strong regular spark shows that the fault might be with the sparking plug. Remove and clean it according to the instructions in Section 3 :8. Alternatively substitute it with a new plug. 
If the spark is weak and irregular, check that the lead is not perished or cracked. If it appears to be defective, renew it and try another test. If there is no improvement, remove the distributor cap and wipe the inside clean and dry. Check the carbon brush located as shown in FIG 3 :2. It should protrude from the cap moulding and be free to move against the pressure of the internal spring. Examine the surface inside the cap for signs of 'tracking' which can be seen as a thin black line between the electrodes or to some metal part in contact with the cap. This is caused by sparking, and the only cure is to fit a new cap. 
Testing the low-tension circuit: 
Before carrying out electrical tests, confirm that the contact breaker points are clean and correctly set, then proceed as follows: 
1 Disconnect the black low-tension cable from the ignition coil and from the side of the distributor. Connect a test lamp between the two terminals. Turn the engine over slowly. If the lamp lights when the contacts close and goes out when they open, the low-tension circuit is in order. If the lamp fails to light the contacts are dirty or there is a break or loose con nection in the low-tension wiring. 
2 If the fault lies in the low-tension circuit, switch on the ignition and turn the crankshaft until the contact breaker points are fully open. Refer to the wiring diagram in Technical Data and check the circuit with 
an 0—20 voltmeter. If the circuit is in order the meter should read approximately 12-volts. 
3 Battery to fuse box terminal 30. Connect the volt meter between the terminal 30 and earth. No reading indicates a faulty cable or loose connection. 
4 Fuse box. Connect the voltmeter between the other auxiliary terminal 30 and earth. No reading indicates a broken or loose connection. 
5 Fuse box auxiliary terminal 30 to terminal number 30 on ignition switch. Connect the meter between terminal number 30 on the ignition switch and earth. No reading indicates a damaged cable or loose connection. 
6 Ignition switch. Connect the meter between termi nal 15/54 and earth. Switch onto the ignition position, when no reading indicates a fault in the switch. 
7 Ignition switch to low-tension cable connection on the coil (blue cable). Connect the meter between ignition coil terminal (blue cable) and earth. No reading indicates a damaged cable or loose con nection. 
8 Ignition coil. Disconnect the black low-tension cable connecting the coil to the distributor side terminal at the coil and connect the meter between this terminal and earth. No reading indicates a fault in the primary winding of the coil and a replacement coil must be fitted. If the reading is correct remake the connections to the coil. 
9 Ignition coil to distributor. Disconnect the thin black low-tension cable at the side of the distributor and connect the meter between the end of this cable and earth. No reading indicates a damaged cable or loose connections. 
10 Contact breaker and capacitor. Connect the meter across the contact breaker points. No reading indicates a faulty capacitor. 
Capacitor: 
The best method of testing a capacitor (condenser) is by substitution. Disconnect the original capacitor and connect a new one between the low-tension terminal on the side of the distributor and earth. 
If a new capacitor is needed, fit a new one complete with bracket, but if necessary unsolder the original bracket and solder it onto the new capacitor using as little heat as possible. Capacitor capacity is .15-.20 microfarads. 
3:5 Removing and dismantling distributor (sedan and sports) 
To remove the distributor proceed as follows: 1 Rotate the engine slowly until the distributor rotor arm is opposite the brass segment in the distributor cap connected to No. 1 plug lead. This will provide a datum for replacement. 
2 Disconnect the cable from the low-tension terminal on the side of the distributor body. Mark position of distri butor on support. Release the distributor retaining nut and washer from the underside of the top flange of the distributor support and carefully lift away the dis tributor. 
3 Pull off the rotor arm. Remove the insulated terminal assembly from the side of distributor body. Release the contact breaker carrier plate retaining screws and con denser flange screw from the outside of the distributor

4 Before further dismantling note the relative positions of the driving dog and the rotor arm driving slot at the top of the distributor cam spindle. The driving dog is offset and can only engage its driving spindle in one position. Then when the cam assembly is fitted to the centrifugal weights during reassembly the timing is not 180 deg. out. 
5 Take out the cam lubrication felt pad recessed in the rotor arm housing on the end of the cam spindle. Remove the retaining screw, carefully disengage the springs and lift out the cam spindle. It should be noted that there is a small retaining ball and spring located in a drilling nearly at the top of the drive shaft spindle. Carefully lift away the weights. 
6 Thoroughly clean all parts and inspect for excessive wear. The distributor cap must not be cracked or show signs of tracking. The cap terminals, rotor and contact breaker points can be cleaned with a very fine file. Emerypaper must not be used. If the clearance between the rotor and distributor cap segments exceeds .0118 inch both the rotor and distributor cap must be replaced. Inspect the contact breaker arm rubbing block for exces sive wear and also the points for wear so that if the gap exceeds the last setting limit of .0209 inch and adjust ment through the stationary contact carrier screw is no longer possible (see FIG 3:2), the contact breaker set must be renewed. 
If the distributor drive shaft side or vertical movement is excessive the distributor must be renewed. Weak centri fugal weight springs or damaged weights must be renewed using original Fiat spares otherwise the auto matic ignition advance characteristics could be altered.

FIG 3:4 Use of fixture Ap.5030/1 to check ignition timing 
Reassembly is the reverse procedure to dismantling but 
the following points should be noted: 
1 Lubricate the parts of the centrifugal advance mecha nism, the drive spindle and the part of the shaft which 
accepts the cam with Fiat VS oil. 
2 Ensure that upon reassembly the slot in the rotor arm housing matches the distributor driving dog. Lubricate 
the felt pad in the rotor arm housing. 
3 Fit the distributor back onto its support gently rotating the rotor arm so that the drive dog engages with the 
drive shaft mating flange. Provided the crankshaft has 
not been turned the rotor arm should finish up pointing 
to No. 1 cylinder segment in the distributor cap. Tighten 
the distributor retaining nut, refit the distributor cap and 
leads to the spark plugs and the LT lead to distributor 
body terminal. 
4 Add a few drops of oil to the distributor shaft lubrication fitting (see FIG 3:3). 
3:6 Removing and dismantling distributor 
(station wagon) 
The distributor is located towards the top rear of the 
engine and is bolted direct onto the crankcase rear cover as shown in FIG 1 :2. It is driven direct by a gear in mesh with a corresponding gear on the camshaft. The basic design of the distributor is the same as that for the sedan and sports engine, except that the distributor cap has been redesigned, there is a gear instead of the dog drive and no distributor support. To remove and dismantle the distributor proceed as previously described taking great care about marking the location of the distributor to rear cover and rotating the engine until No. 1 cylinder is on compression. This will ensure that reassembly is straightforward without loss of ignition timing.

Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine
3:7 Timing the ignition 
It is necessary to retime the ignition should the distribu tor shaft or camshaft have been removed. To retime the ignition proceed as follows: 
1 On the timing sprocket cover fit Fiat tool AP.5030/1 as shown in FIG 3:4. Ensure No. 1 cylinder is on the compression stroke with both valves closed. Rotate the crankshaft until the mark on the centrifugal filter cover lines up with the 10° mark on the fixture. This setting corresponds to a 10° static advance BTDC. 
2 Check that the points gap is correctly set between .018 and .020 inch. Turn the distributor shaft until the rotor points in the direction of No. 1 segment in the cap and the points are just opening. 
3 Without disturbing the distributor shaft, insert the lower coupling on its toothed end, install the support and tighten the locknut. Secure the distributor to the sup port using the mounting screw. 
To check that the distributor is properly timed to the engine and the centrifugal automatic advance is operating correctly giving a total advance of 18° to 28° respectively proceed as follows: 
1 Connect Fiat timing tester AP.5030 with a 220-volt single-phase power outlet fitted with a good earth connection. It is important that the tester is earthed before it is allowed to operate. Also ensure that the tester earth terminal is connected to a bare metal part of the vehicle. 
2 Remove No. 1 spark plug lead, insert the strobe light adapter and reconnect the spark plug lead. Using a piece of white chalk mark the TDC position on the centrifugal filter cover. 
3 Start the engine and aim the strobe light beam towards the chalk mark drawn on the centrifugal filter cover. With the engine running slowly the mark on the centri fugal cover must correspond with the first white line on the fixture (10°). Slowly increase the speed of the engine so operating the automatic advance and the chalk mark should move counterclockwise until at maximum speed it reaches the second white mark on the fixture. 
It should be noted that the ignition timing for the model 500 sports engine the static advance is 10°, an automatic advance of 12° giving a total advance at maximum engine speed of 22°. 
Should Fiat fixture AP.5030/1 not be available the advance position may be set as follows: 
1 Turn over the engine until No. 1 piston is on the com pression stroke with both valves closed. 
2 Rotate the crankshaft clockwise until the reference mark cast on the centrifugal filter cover is set .5118 to .5512 inch ahead of the arrow cast on the timing sprocket cover. This will give a static advance setting of 10° BTDC. 
3 Proceed as directed for ignition distributor timing and mounting described earlier in this section. 
3:8 Sparking plugs 
The sparking plugs must be regularly inspected, cleaned and the electrode gap adjusted to a gap of .019 to .023 inch. 
The inspection of the deposits on the electrodes is par ticularly useful because the colour and type of deposit 
indicates the condition inside the combustion chamber 
and may be used as a guide to engine tuning. 
Before the spark plugs are removed blow away any 
loose dirt from the plug recesses using a compressed air 
jet or tyre pump. Store the plugs in the order of removal 
ready for inspection. 
Examine the gaskets and if they are about half their 
thickness they may be used again otherwise they must be 
replaced. 
Inspect the electrode end of the plugs and note the 
type and colour of the deposit. Normally it should be 
powdery and range from brown to a greyish tan in colour. 
There will also be slight wear of the electrodes and the 
general effect described is one which comes from mixed 
periods of high-speed and low-speed driving. Cleaning 
and resetting the gap is all that will be necessary. 
If the deposits are white or yellowish they indicate long 
periods of constant-speed driving or much low-speed 
city driving. Again, the treatment is straightforward. 
Dry, black, fluffy deposits are usually the result of 
running with too rich a mixture. Incomplete combustion 
of the petrol air charge may also be a cause and this might 
be traced to a defect in the ignition system or excessive 
idling. 
Overheated sparking plugs have a white blistered look 
about the centre electrode and the side electrode may be 
badly eroded. This may be caused by poor cooling, wrong 
ignition timing or sustained high speeds under heavy load. 
To clean the sparking plugs effectively they should be 
cleaned using an abrasive blasting machine and tested 
under pressure once the electrodes have been reset. File 
these until they are clean, bright and the faces parallel and 
set the gap to .019 to .023 inch. Do not try to bend the 
centre electrode. 
Before replacing the plugs use a wire brush to clean the 
threads taking care that the electrodes are not touched. 
Thoroughly clean the spark plug in petrol, and dry using a 
compressed air jet or a tyre pump. If difficulty is found in 
screwing the plugs into the cylinder head by hand run a 
tap down the threads to clear away any carbon. If a tap is 
not available use an old sparking plug with crosscuts down 
Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine
the threads. Finally tighten the plugs to a torque wrench setting of 18 to 21 Ib ft. 
Sparking plug leads: 
The spark plug leads and the lead from the coil to the distributor cap must be regularly checked for cracking of the insulation and also correct seating in the distributor cap and coil top. It is recommended that silicone grease is smeared around the sockets before the leads are replaced to ensure no moisture may enter causing difficult starting. 
3:9 The distributor driving spindle (sedan and sports engine) 
If for any reason, the driving spindle has been removed from its housing in the crankcase, it must be correctly meshed with the camshaft gear otherwise it will be impos sible to set the ignition timing.

4:1 Description 
Sedan: 
All the Fiat new 500 models covered by this manual are aircooled by the forced air circulation system from a centrifugal blower which is mounted on the generator output shaft. The blower fan has fourteen vanes which are arranged at various angles to reduce operating noise during high-speed operation. A specially designed cowling as shown in FIGS 4:1 and 4:2 conveys the air from the blower and distributes it to the various parts of the exterior of the engine. 
The main components of the air cooling system are as follows: 
1 Air intake compartment at the rear end of the body. 2 An elbow pipe for the admittance of incoming air. 3 A flexible air pipe connecting the elbow pipe to the conveyor. 
4 A spiral air conveyor which contains the centrifugal fan. 5 Distribution ducting for directing the air flow to various parts of the engine. 
6 A bellows type thermostat is fitted to the cowling which operates a butterfly shutter controlling the air outlet from the engine which ensures control of the engine operating temperature. 
When the shutter is in the open position, engine heated air is allowed to disperse to the outside of the engine cowling. With the shutter in its closed position, the air is recirculated in the engine cowling so ensuring a quick engine warm-up period. 
It should be noted that by operating the heater lever which is located on the centre tunnel at the rear seat, warmed air flowing out from the engine cowling is passed to the inside of the car for heating and demisting purposes. 
Station wagon: 
Refer to FIG 4:2 where it will be seen that as the engine is located on its side underneath the luggage compartment floor the ducting has been modified and the air intakes are located at the rear of the side windows. A linear blower is housed in the engine baffles and cowling and is attached to the drive end of the generator. 
The thermostat 'C' (see FIG 4:2) is located on the righthand side of the engine cowling and should start opening the engine heated air outlet shutter 'D' when the temperature of the air rises to 178-185°F and the shutter should be wide open when the air is at a temperature of 196-207°F.

4:2 Air outlet thermostat and shutter 
Refer to FIGS 4 :1 and 4 :2 where it will be seen that 
the thermostat is located on the righthand side of the engine cowling. The thermostat should start opening the engine heated air outlet shutter when the temperature of the air reaches between 158-165°F (178-185°F station wagon) and the shutter should be in the wide open posi tion when the air has reached a temperature of between 178-189°F (196-207°F station wagon). 
When the engine cooling air control system is being 
inspected or serviced the following points should be noted: 
1 Check that when the shutter is in the closed position the edge mates perfectly with the cowling 
seating. 
2 Ensure that the shutter can swivel freely. 
3 Check that the initial thermostat movement is between .0197 to .0394 inch. 
4 Generally check the engine cowling for distortion, bad jbint sealing or cracks.

4:4 Heating system safety device 
110F series sedan engines and later station wagon engines incorporate a modification to the cylinder head designed so that in the event of cylinder head gasket failure exhaust gases are expelled outside the engine and not leaked into the heating system. 
The safety device comprises a square section circular seat 1 (see FIG 4 :6) which is formed in the upper face of the cylinder, a special duct in the cylinder head and a pierced screw 3 for each cylinder. 
The system is so designed that the exhaust gases are released to the atmosphere from the circular seat in the cylinder via the duct 2 and the pierced screw 3. It should be noted that the screw 3 is also used for securing the conveyor. 
4:5 Maintenance 
Due to the simple design of the air cooling system maintenance has been kept to an absolute minimum and should consist of the following checks: 
1 Inspect all the air conveyor system joints and ensure that all the joint nuts and bolts are tight and that there is no distortion between two joint faces. 
2 Check that the tension of the generator and fan drive belt is correct: with a hand pressure of approximately 22 Ib the belt should sag 13/32 inch. Adjust if necessary as detailed in Chapter 1. 
3 Ensure that the shutter can swivel freely and that the spring is in a serviceable condition.

Fault diagnosis 

5:1 Description 
New 500, 500D sedan and early station wagon: The clutch is a single plate dry disc type operating on the inner face of the flywheel. FIG 5 :1 shows a longitudi nal cross section of the clutch as it is assembled in the power unit. 
A sheet metal clutch cover is attached to the flywheel by means of six screws and this encloses a clutch driven plate, the pressure plate and six springs. Three withdrawal levers are fitted so that the inner ends are attached to a carrier ring through which three springs hold the levers in place and the carrier ring in contact with the pressure plate, (see FIG 5:1). Release of the driven plate is obtained through a throw-out ring fitted with a central carbon thrust ring which acts on the withdrawal levers carrier ring. This is controlled by the clutch pedal through suitable linkage to the control fork. 
When the clutch pedal is operated, the throw-out ring, together with the carbon thrust ring is pushed towards the flywheel and this exerts a pressure on the withdrawal levers carrier ring and the lever inner tips. The lever outer tips lift the pressure plate so disengaging the clutch. 
Each of the three withdrawal levers is mounted on a bolt together with an adjustment nut which is inserted in the pressure plate. The levers are kept in their location by a guide which is formed in the pressure plate. 
500 F and L sedans and late station wagon: 
A single plate dry type clutch is fitted with a diaphragm pressure spring. This design of clutch differs from the con ventional clutch because the pressure coil springs and throw-out mechanism components are replaced by a single diaphragm spring. 
The new system offers certain advantages which are as follows: 
1 The load on the clutch pedal does not increase as the clutch disc lining wears but remains constant through out the life of the clutch. 
2 Due to the special shape and location of the diaphragm spring, which offers a constant force on the pressure plate throughout the clutch life, the clutch does not slip even though the driven plate linings may be worn.

5:2 Removal and installation 
To remove the clutch unit from the vehicle proceed as 
follows: 
1 Remove the engine (Chapter 1) or separate the gear box from the engine as described in Chapter 6. 
2 Remove the six screws and washers that secure the clutch cover to the flywheel and gently ease the cover 
assembly from the location dowels in the flywheel and 
lift away. This will also free the driven plate. 
3 Carefully clean the driven plate and clutch cover using a compressed air jet. 
4 To refit the clutch cover assembly to the flywheel ensure that the driven plate is assembled the correct 
way round as shown in FIG 5 :1 and place the cover 
onto the flywheel using the locating dowels. 
5 To ensure that the driven plate is correctly centred use Fiat pilot A.62023 (see FIG 5 : 5) or a suitably sized 
mandrel. Tighten the clutch mounting screws diagonally 
a turn at a time to ensure correct location of the cover 
onto the flywheel face. Finally, tighten to a torque 
wrench setting of 5.8 to 7.2 Ib ft. 
5 :3 Dismantling and inspection of clutch cover 
New 500, 500D sedan and early 500 station wagon : To dismantle the clutch cover assembly proceed as 
follows: 
60 
Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine
1 Place the clutch cover assembly on Fiat fixture A.62038 as shown in FIG 5 :6 and lock the cover using the three T-handles provided. 
2 Release the withdrawal lever carrier ring springs and lift away the ring. 
3 Unscrew the withdrawal lever fixing nuts on the bolts and lift out the levers and washers. Gradually slacken the three T-handles so relieving the pressure of the clutch springs. Remove the clutch cover, springs and lever mounting bolts. Carefully mark all the components to ensure that they are assembled correctly so ensuring that correct balance of the clutch unit is obtained. 
Inspection: 
Thoroughly clean all parts using a compressed air jet and proceed as follows: 
1 Thoroughly check the springs for signs of overheating causing loss of tension and compare the effective length of the springs which when fitted new should have a length of .9646 inch under a load of not less than 43 Ib. If the spring length is less than the recommended dimension fit a complete new set of springs. 
2 The length of the withdrawal lever carrier ring retaining springs should be checked which under a normal clutch load should be .7677 inch whilst the length'of the expanded spring under a load of 4.85 ± .44 Ib should be 1.1811 inch. If the springs show sign of heating or weakening a new set should be fitted. 
3 Check the withdrawal levers and their bolts for exces sive wear and fit new parts as necessary. 
4 Inspect the pressure plate for an excessively ridged sur face or signs of cracking. If the ridges are not too severe the face may be refaced by turning on a centre lathe. Also inspect the flywheel friction surface which may also be refaced providing that the ridges are not too severe. 
5 Whenever the clutch driven plate linings are worn a new driven plate should be fitted. 
6 Inspect the clutch shaft splines and these should not have a lengthwise clearance in excess of .0039 inch and side clearance of .0118 inch with respect to the driven plate hub. Ensure that the driven plate slides easily on the clutch shaft protruding from the rear of the gearbox differential unit as any plate drag may be the cause of difficulty in gear selection. 
5 :4 Assembly and adjustment 
New 500 sedan 
To assemble the clutch cover assembly proceed as follows: 
1 Place the pressure plate complete with carrier ring bolts and springs on Fiat fixture 62038 (see FIG 5:2). 2 Fit the six pressure springs in their respective seats on the pressure plate. Insert the cups on the springs and replace the cover. 
3 Compress the clutch cover, continually checking that the withdrawal lever supporting bolts are properly guided into their holes in the cover. Onto the bolts, fit the three withdrawal levers with their relevant nuts and washers. 
4 Replace the carrier ring on the levers and hook up the retaining springs.

6 :1 Description 
The gearbox and differential unit are housed in an aluminium alloy casing made up of two parts which split at the differential centre line. The output drive is trans mitted by means of two half axle drive shafts coupled through wheel shafts and slip joints to the rear wheels (see FIG 6:1) 
The gearbox provides four forward-speeds and a reverse, the fourth-speed being considered as an overdrive. All gears except first and reverse gears, which are straight toothed sliding gears, are in constant mesh and have heli cal teeth. No synchromesh is provided, gear engagement being completed by sliding shifter sleeves of the dog clutch type. The first-speed gear slides on the outside of the third and fourth shifter sleeve, whilst the reverse gear train moves on a fixed shaft. The clutch shaft is integral with the third, top and combined and first and second gear pinions, whilst the second gear pinion is splined at the front end. An internal splined coupling sleeve joins the clutch shaft and the input shaft and transmits the power from the engine to the gearbox. The mainshaft and differential drive pinion are combined together and besides carrying the constant mesh gears and the sliding first gear pinion, it also has attached the sliding sleeves and hubs. 
The speedometer drive pinion is located at the front end. The gearbox/differential casing is attached to the engine by six studs which locate in the crankcase. The front of the unit rests upon the rubber mounted support which is secured to the body floor. 
The complete unit comprises three detachable parts made up as follows: 
1 The support for the connection of the gearbox to the engine which also acts as part of the differential front end and clutch/flywheel housing at rear. 
2 A central body which is divided into two compartments. The front compartment contains first, third, fourth and reverse gears with the primary shaft, layshaft and reverse shaft as well as the necessary gear selection striker rods and forks. The rear of this compartment also forms a half cover for the differential unit. 
3 The gearbox casing cover, which contains the second speed gears together with the relative fork, gear selection rod and speedometer drive gears. 
The central part of the casing is provided with a top inspection cover. The primary shaft is coupled to the clutch shaft through an internally splined sleeve and two pins which are retained by rings. The primary shaft together with the first, third and fourth driving gears form a cluster.

FIG 6:1 Gearbox-differential unit longitudinal section 

On the primary shaft extension outside the main central 
body is mounted the second-speed driving gear. The 
primary shaft is supported at both ends by ballbearings 
whilst the clutch shaft rotates in a bronze spigot bush which 
is press fitted into the end of the crankshaft. An oil seal is 
fitted in the clutch shaft passage seat in the connection 
support. The layshaft, together with the drive pinion of the 
differential unit is supported at the front by a ballbearing 
race. The layshaft carries the pinion adjustment shim, the 
fourth-speed driven gear and its bushing, the hub and 
relevant engagement sleeve for the third- and fourth 
speed with first-speed and reverse-speed, the third-speed 
gear and bushing and, outside the casing the second gear 
and bushing, the hub with relevant second-speed engage 
ment sleeve and the speedometer drive gear. 
The gears are operated by a gear selection lever mounted 
on the tunnel situated between the two front seats. This 
operates through a rod actuating the selector and shifting 
mechanism which is housed in the gearbox casing cover. 
Refer to FIG 6 :3 where it will be seen that the positioning 
of the striker rods is ensured by a spring-loaded ball 
bearing. The risk of engaging two gears at the same time is 
eliminated by three rollers which slide in suitable slots 
machined in the rod (see FIG 6:4). 
The differential unit and the final drive gear train are 
housed in the two semi-covers which have previously 
been described, the final drive pinion being integral with 
the layshaft. The differential casing may be split into two 
halves. The bevel gear is fitted on one of the halves and is 
66 
Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine
secured by the same screws joining the two halves together. The differential side gears are internally splined into which are located the splined axle shaft ends which are able to slide by means of a specially designed slip joint. Two specially shaped rubber oil boots are inserted on the swing axle shafts and fit over the side gear extensions to ensure that there is no loss of lubricant or the ingress of dirt. 
The transmission and differential unit to suit the station wagon differs from the sedan in that the transmission to engine mounting plate and the bellhousing are modified to suit the engine repositioned on its side. 
6:2 Removal of gearbox/differential unit: 
The complete unit may be removed whilst the engine remains in situ and to remove this unit proceed as follows: 1 Disconnect the battery positive cable and jack up the 
rear of the vehicle and place on firmly based stands. 2 Disconnect all control cables and wiring from the starter motor and the clutch lever. Remove the starter motor, the clutch lever reaction spring and the clutch cable support on the gearbox. 
3 Remove the three bolts securing each of the driving shaft flanges to the flexible coupling at the wheel ends and carefully take out the inner spring. 
4 Disconnect the shifter rod from the gearshift lever at the gearbox extension and also the speedometer drive cable. Remove also the flywheel undercover. Place a suitable support under the engine.

withdraw the layshaft together with the final drive pinion and the roller bearing inner race from the rear. 11 From the inside of the gearbox casing carefully slide off the following parts from the mainshaft, the drive pinion adjustment shim, the third and fourth driven speed gears together with their bushes, the third- and fourth-speed hub and sliding sleeve, the first and reverse driven gear, and carefully drive out the front bearings and the bevel pinion rear bearing outer race. 1 2 Using a suitable press, drive out the drive pinion roller bearing inner race from the end of the mainshaft. 
Inspection of components: 
Before inspecting the various parts removed from the gearbox casing thoroughly wash all components and blow dry using a compressed air jet and then proceed as follows: 
1 Thoroughly inspect the gearbox casing to ensure that it is not cracked and that the bearing seats are neither 
worn or damaged so allowing the bearing outer ring to rotate during the normal operation. 
2 Thoroughly check the ballbearings to ensure that they are in perfect condition and that both radial ply and axial play is not excessive. The maximum permissible bearing play is as follows: 
Front bearings of primary shaft layshaft: 
(a) Sideways .002 inch 
(b) Endwise .017 inch 
Primary shaft rear bearing: 
(a) Sideways .002 inch 
(b) Endwise .016 inch 
Hold the bearings firmly by the outer race and gently rock the inner race backwards and forwards. The sliding action produced should be free and silent. If any rough ness is felt then the bearings must be renewed. Check the roller bearings by inspecting the condition of the rollers as well as the outer and inner races. Always fit new bearings if there is any doubt as to their efficiency. 

F500 69 Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine

3 Check the layshaft and the primary shaft between centres and using a dial gauge ensure that there is no distortion. The out of true reading for bearing seats 
should be less than .0008 inch. Inspect the splines and ensure that the side and outerfaces are not indented. 
Replace if there are signs of wear. Also inspect the 
reverse shaft to ensure that it is perfectly smooth and 
not showing signs of pitting or partial seizure. 
4 Carefully inspect all gear teeth for signs of excessive wear or damage. The contact faces must be smooth and show no signs of indentation marks. Also check that the backlash between the gears, when correctly mounted on the surface plate is not greater than .0039 inch. The maximum wear limit is .0079 inch. Check that the quick engagement front teeth of the second-, third and fourth-speed gears are not damaged or excessively worn. Renew if there are signs of gearchange lever misuse. 
5 Inspect the sliding sleeves and the relevent hubs, ensure that all the working surfaces are perfectly smooth. The clearance between the mating parts should not be greater than .0059 inch. Also inspect the meshing teeth and ensure that they are in good condition. 
6 Check that the gear shifting selector forks are not dis torted and that the striker rods freely slide in their seats in the gearbox casing. 
7 Carefully inspect that all the oil seals are in perfect con dition and if there is any doubt they should be renewed. 8 Inspect the striker rod locking balls and the safety rollers and ensure that they slide freely in their seatings. Also check the ball load spring efficiency and if this shows signs of weakness then it should be renewed. Any faults with these items will cause difficulty in engaging gears or autodisengagement during engine acceleration. 
6:4 Reassembly—gearbox 
To reassemble the components to the gearbox ensure that all components are thoroughly clean and then pro ceed as follows: 
1 Press the pinion rear roller bearing onto the layshaft. Install the layshaft in the casing, and at the same time 
fit the adjustment shim, the fourth-speed driven gear 
together with its bush, the sleeve and hub for third and 
fourth gear engagement, the first-speed and reverse 
driven gear and the third-speed driven gear with its 
hub. 
2 Install the front layshaft ballbearing securing the bearing retainment plate with the screws and finally 
lock the screws in position. 
3 Insert the primary shaft together with the first, third and fourth driving gear train in the gearbox housing 
and slide the rear bearing onto the shaft. Push the 
input shaft forward to enable the clutch shaft coupling 
to be inserted in the rear and to be pulled up the 
primary shaft by means of the pin. Do not forget the 
retaining ring. 
4 Slide the primary shaft backwards so pushing the rear bearing into its bore. Refit the front bearing onto the 
primary shaft. 
5 On the layshaft insert the second-speed driven shaft and bush, the second gear sliding dog sleeve and the 
hub. Also insert the second-speed striker rod and the 
first-speed fork. Do not forget to fit the safety roller 
into its seating.

Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine
6 Slide the second-speed driving gear onto the primary shaft. Place the engagement fork on the third- and fourth-speed engagement sliding sleeve, and insert the striker rod, lock the relevent fork and fit the safety roller. 
7 Insert the third safety roller and install the reverse shaft and insert the reverse gear cluster onto it and secure the shaft by tightening its block bolt. Install the reverse striker rod with its relevent fork. 
8 Now refit the speedometer drive worm gear onto the layshraft. Tighten the nuts on the primary shaft and the layshaft, not forgetting to interpose the plain washer between the speedometer driving worm and the nut, to a torque wrench setting of 1 8.1 Ib ft to 25.3 Ib ft (primary shaft) and 28.9 to 36.2 Ib ft (layshaft). It is recommended that the input shaft and layshaft are locked together by engaging two gears at the same time. Finally, fit the splitpins. 
9 Lock the shifter forks onto their shafts by tightening their respective bolts and bend up the special locking plates. Install the three positioning balls and relevant springs into their bores and refit the cover plate. 
10 Install the casing cover together with its relevant gasket. This will enable correct positioning of the shift shaft lever so that it engages in the outer ends of the shifter shafts protruding from the gearbox casing. 
11 Install the speedometer drive support on the gearbox casing and refit the upper gearbox cover. 
For subsequent differential operations and adjustments see Sections 6:6. 
6:5 Dismantling—differential and final drive 
For the removal of the differential and final drive unit from the gearbox refer to Section 6:3. To dismantle the differential assembly proceed as follows: 
1 Remove the retaining ring 2 (see FIG 6:7) retaining the splined sleeve 4 and slide the sleeve off the drive shaft. 
2 Remove the retaining covers 7 and the oil boots all together with the bushes and seals, adjuster ring lock rings 13, adjuster rings housing 14, and bearing adjuster and roller bearing outer races. 
3 Separate the differential housing halves by unscrewing and removing the six bolts that keep both the halves and the crownwheel together. It is advisable to mark the respective components to ensure correct matching upon reassembly. 
4 Remove the differential pinion shaft retainer ring, also the differential pinions 10 by removing the shaft and withdrawing the two axle shafts 1. 
5 Remove the differential side gears 6 and relevent thrust rings 8. 
6 Using a press remove the differential bearing inner races from their seats on the carrier halves. 
7 Thoroughly clean all parts and dry using a compressed air jet. 
Inspection: 
The components of the differential unit must be thoroughly inspected for correct operation and to deter mine the presence of any wear, damage or other irregulari ties. To check the items concerned proceed as follows: 
1 Check thoroughly the idle pinion carrier shaft for signs 

of wear, distorting or unevenness of the surfaces as this part is very heavily pressed when the vehicle is negotia ting a corner. If the clearance to the idle pinions exceeds .0059 inch the shaft must be renewed. 
2 Inspect the ring gear and pinion seat, the side gears.and the idle pinions for correct meshing. This will be shown up by white marks on the sides of the gear teeth. Check that none of the teeth are broken, chipped or exces sively worn and if any part is suspect then it must be renewed not forgetting that the ring gear and pinion come as a matched pair. 
3 Inspect the condition of the ball and roller bearings, the rollers and balls and working faces must not show signs of pitting wear or cracking and if any part is suspect then the race must be renewed. 
4 Check that there is not any undue wear on the faces of the thrust rings. Any slight indentations may be evened out using a fine oil stone but if the damage is excessive then new rings or oversize rings must befitted as neces sary. Thrust rings are supplied as service spares in the following thicknesses. 
Standard .0394 inch Oversize .0512-.0591 inch 
6:6 Reassembly—differential unit 
To reassemble the differential case proceed as follows: 1 Press onto the differential half housing which carries the ring gear one differential bearing inner race ensuring that it is pushed fully home onto its seating. Install the thrust ring and side gear (see FIG 6 :7). 
2 From the inside of the case insert the axle shaft com plete with pivot and runners that form the slip joint. Also install the idle pinions and carrier shaft. Position the ring gear onto the housing half and install the differential pinion shaft retainer ring. 
3 Press the other differential bearing inner race onto its seating on the left differential housing half and replace the left axle shaft complete with slip joint. 
4 Join the two case halves together and tighten the retaining screws and also the retaining screws of the ring gear to a torque wrench setting of 23.1 Ib ft. Secure all screws by bending up the lockplates. 
5 Press the differential bearing outer races into their seatings in the bearing housings and also fit the oil seals. Also install the bearing housings over the driving shafts together with the adjuster rings. 
6 Install the differential unit assembly into the final drive housing front half and bolt the rear half onto it. Tighten the six mounting nuts to a torque wrench setting of 27.5 Ib ft. Finally place the bearing housings in their seats and tighten the mounting nuts to a torque wrench setting of 13 lb ft. 
It should be noted that after the gearbox has been over hauled the complete differential unit should only be in stalled after the drive pinion depth adjustments has been carried out. 
6:7 Final drive gear set adjustment 
The installation and adjustment of the final drive gear set requires special care otherwise the unit may have to be dismantled again for further adjustment. So as to establish the correct mesh of the two gears, their relative position is accurately set during initial assembly at the factory. 
FIG 6:8 Layshaft with final drive pinion. The arrow points to the number (14) for correct mating with ring gear and to the centesimal figure (—10) for accurate mating position of pinion and gear 
Refer to FIG 6 :8 where it will be seen that two numbers are stamped on the pinion shaft near to the threaded end, the upper number is the matching number which should also appear on the crownwheel. The lower number indi cates the positive or negative deviation from the theoretical distance between the centre line of the ring gear and the 
pinion face. It is this number which must be taken into account when calculating the adjusting shim thickness which has to be fitted between the rear roller bearing and the fourth-speed gear on the layshaft. 
The formula from which the adjusting shim thickness can be calculated is as follows: 
S=A—(B + C) 
Where S=shim thickness. 
A= distance between the front bearing inner race and the centre line of the ring gear. 
B = distance of the drive pinion face to the ring gear centre line. 
C=the total of the widths of the third-speed gear bush, third- and fourth-speed hub, 
fourth-speed gear bush and rear roller 
bearing inner race fitted onto the mainshaft 
It should be noted that 'A' is the total of half the diameter of the differential bearing housing seat which is in actual fact 41.00 mm, and the distance measured between the front bearing inner race and the differential bearing housing seat. The last dimension will have a minimum manufactu ring limit of 150.54 mm. Any deviation from this value must be determined and considered when determining the total shim thickness 'S'. 
A= 150.54 + 41.00 + a (deviation) 
To determine deviation 'a' Fiat tool A.62036 should be assembled to the gearbox casing as shown in FIG 6:9 and to take the reading proceed as follows: 
1 Assemble the front ballbearing and its retainer into the gearbox housing and tighten the retainer bolts. 2 Hold the gearbox housing in the vertical position with the differential side upwards and insert Fiat tool A.62036 carefully from above into the bearing bore and lock it firmly by tightening the knurled nut. 
3 Using Fiat dial gauge C.689 which has been previously zeroed on a surface plate should next be mounted onto the top of Fiat tool A.62036 with its pointer resting on the lowest position of the differential bearing hous ing bore as shown in FIG 6:10. To obtain the lowest point move the pointer to both sides of the bottom dead centre position so as to obtain the maximum reading. The distance 'B' in the formula for calculating the shim 
thickness is designed to have a lower manufacturing limit of 75 mm. Any deviation 'b' is stamped on the drive pinion. Therefore to calculate the value of 'B' 
B= 7 5 + b (deviation) 
The distance 'C' in the formula for calculating the shim thickness is designed to have a lower manufacturing limit

FIG 6:11 Setting dial indicator to zero on tool A.62037 
of 115.64 mm. Fiat tool A.62037 as shown in FIG 6:12 used in conjunction with the dial gauge can now be used to measure the deviation 'c' from the lower manufacturing limit as follows: 
1 Place the dial gauge on a stand on the surface plate and place Fiat tool A.62037 on the plate as shown in the FIG 6:11. 
2 Carefully slide onto the Fiat tool the following items, third-speed driven bush, third- and fourth-speed gear engagement sleeve, hub, fourth-speed driven gear bush and drive pinion roller bearing inner race. Set the dial gauge to zero using Fiat tool A.62037 as the datum and then rest the dial gauge plunger on the roller bearing inner race and take a reading at the dial as shown in FIG 6 :11. This reading will represent 'c' which can now be used in the formula. 
C = 1 1 5 . 6 4 + c (deviation) 
Once the values of A', 'B' and 'C have been found as detailed above we can now insert the values into the basic formula S = A—(B + C) which will now give us: 
S = 1 50.54 + 41.00+ a — (75+ b +115.64 +c) which can be simplified by using algebra to give us the following formula: 
S = 0.90 + a —(b + c) 
Shims are supplied in the following thicknesses, .0039 inch and .0059 inch. One or more shims should be used to make up the required shim thickness.

rear bearing outer shoulder. 
Ring gear clearance and differential bearing pre load : 
To enable the correct ring gear tooth clearance to be ascertained use Fiat tool A.62039 together with a dial gauge. The support for dial gauge should be fixed into the two lower bolt holes of the flywheel housing and the pointer of the dial gauge adjusted so that it is located through the clutch shaft hole in the final drive housing so resting on a ring gear tooth (see FIG 6:15). Then proceed as follows: 
1 During reassembly the differential bearing nuts should not have been screwed fully home to the differential

bearing outer races when installing into the final drive unit. These should now be carefully screwed in until they are in gentle contact with the bearing races. 
2 Slide Fiat tool A.62040 over one of the drive shafts and using Fiat tool A.62041 lock the drive shaft to the differential housing thus preventing the drive pinion from rotating. 
3 Gently turn the drive shaft which should now be locked to the ring gear and note the movement of the dial gauge indicator. This will show the tooth clear ance. When the clearance is correctly adjusted the

Excessive contact on tooth face. Too slight meshing—move pinion in towards ring gear by in creasing thickness of shim. 
Excessive contact of tooth toe. Too deep meshing —move pinion out from ring gear by reducing thickness of shim. 
With all the above detailed cases, to adjust the pinion by replacing the shim, the differential unit and drive pinion shaft must be dismantled. This means that when the unit is reassembled after the necessary adjustments have been made, the backlash and bearing rotation torque must be repeated. 
6:8 Replacement of gearbox—differential unit 
Installation is the reverse procedure to removal of the unit from the vehicle as described in Section 6:2. However, the following points should be noted: 1 Ensure that the clutch driven disc hub is correctly 

FIG 6:15 Adjusting ring gear-to-pinion backlash and differential bearing play, using special wrench A.52022 
reading on the dial gauge should be between .0031 to 
.0047 inch. The actual clearance is adjusted by 
screwing in one adjusting nut and screwing out the 
other by the equivalent amount using Fiat spanner 
A.52022 as shown in FIG 6:15. 
4 Remove Fiat tool A.62041 and using Fiat support A.62040 mount the special dynamometer A.95697 and 
adaptor on the axle shaft. Rotate the axle shaft several 
turns so seating the bearings and then check using 
the dynamometer the rotation torque. 
5 If necessary tighten or slacken the adjusters until the specified torque of 1.01 ± .07 lb ft is obtained. This 
operation must be very carefully carried out because if 
one adjuster is set differently with respect to the other, 
a variation in ring gear to pinion backlash may take 
place, resulting in a variation of rotation torque. After 
any adjustments always recheck on the ring gear to 
pinion backlash and if necessary readjust and then 
repeat the rotation torque check. 
6 Finally check the tooth contact between the pinion and ring gear as detailed in the following instructions: 
Check and adjustment of tooth contact between pinion and ring gear: 
1 Carefully apply to the ring gear teeth a thin layer of engineers' blue and gently rotate the differential whilst 
holding the axle shaft firmly but allowing them to slip 
slightly so as to have the unit working under load 
conditions. 
2 A contact impression will be left on the ring gear teeth and the contact will be correct when the drive pinion 
tooth contact pattern is evenly distributed on the ring 
gear teeth as shown in FIG 6:16. Should the tooth 
contact be incorrect the following observations should 
be noted. 
Excessive contact on tooth flank. Too deep 
meshing — move pinion out from ring gear by reducing 
thickness of shim. 
Excessive contact on tooth heel. Too slight 
meshing—move pinion in towards ring gear by 
increasing thickness of shim.

aligned with the clutch shaft pilot bush. 
2 The complete transmission unit should be carefully pushed towards the engine and the clutch shaft inserted into the driven disc hub splines and finally home into the pilot bush. Extreme care must be taken to ensure that no weight is placed on the clutch shaft otherwise distortion may take place. 
3 Carefully connect the gearbox rear housing to the engine crankcase by using the studs, two of which have special location dowels fitted. Screw home finger tight the gearbox/differential to body to front support mounting screws inserting the fibre washers. Lower the hydraulic garage jack and pull it away from underneath the vehicle. Screw in the four lower mounting nuts and tighten to a torque wrench setting of between 18.1 to 21.7 Ib ft.Finally tighten the front support screws. 
4 Reconnect the gear shift control rod and the speedo meter drive cable. Insert the springs between the axle shafts and wheel drive shaft and tighten the three mounting screws of each splined sleeve on the flexible joint to a torque wrench setting of 20.3 Ib ft. 
5 Refit the flywheel housing cover. Replace the starter motor together with its relevant cover and tighten the two mounting nuts to a torque wrench setting of 18.1 to 21.7 Ib ft. Reconnect the starter control rod, the two starter cables, the clutch control tie rod and hook up the return spring and secure the clutch control cable retainer bracket to the gearbox casings. Reconnect the cable to the battery positive terminal post 
6 Lower the vehicle to the floor gently and then give a thorough road testing. 
6 :9 Swing axle shafts and slip joints 
Description: 
The two axle shafts are connected to the differential unit through specially designed slip joints which allow the shafts to swing and slide in the splined housing in the differential side gear. At the other end, the axle shafts are connected to the wheel drive shaft flexible joints using a sliding sleeve.

Repair and inspection : 
Whilst servicing the assembly thoroughly check the 
condition of the slip joints sliding surfaces and the 
housing in the differential side gears. If, due to wear, the 
clearance is greater than .008 inch the slip joints should 
be renewed or in extreme cases the differential side gears 
as well. 
Also check the clearance between the slip joint pivots 
and runners and if it is found to be excessive the axle 
shafts must be renewed as well as the runners as the 
joint pivot is not supplied as a service spare part. The axle 
shaft to sliding sleeve spline clearance should not exceed 
.006 inch. 
Check that the sliding sleeve snap ring is a snug fit in 
its seating groove on the shaft. 
Whenever the vehicle is being serviced the condition 
of the boots, bushings and oil seals should be checked 
and any damaged parts renewed. 
6:10 Gear shift control mechanism 
Should difficulty be experienced in obtaining correct 
gear selection then the gear shift control mechanism 
should be adjusted as follows: 
1 Remove the screws fixing the cover to the tunnel and 
raise the cover to the top of the gear shift lever stem. 
2 Slacken the lever support mounting screws and push 
the support forward if first- and third-speed engage 
ment is incorrect or backwards if second-, fourth- and 
reverse-speed engagement are incorrect. Finally tighten 
the mounting screws. Refit the gear shift lever boot. 
Removal: 
To remove the gear shift control mechanism from the 
car proceed as follows: 
1 Unscrew the gear shift control lever knob and the boot 
fixing screws and slide the boot from the gear shift 
lever.

7:1 Description 
The rear wheels are independently sprung by means of coil springs and V-shaped swinging arms acting on coil springs and telescopic double acting hydraulic shock absorbers. The swinging arms are mounted at their inner ends on 'estendblocks', the coil spring is fitted at the outer end of the swinging arm. At the wheel end of the suspen sion arm is attached a steel pressing to which the brake backplate and wheel bearing housing are bolted so forming a swinging unit to which is attached the road wheel. 
The inner pivots are so located vertical wheel move ments do not influence the drive shaft length which means that there is no need to fit a splined joint at the wheel end. Two taper roller bearings which are separated by a specially designed collapsible spacer are located in the rear wheel bearing housing and this carries the axle shaft. The outer end of the axle shaft is flanged and it is to this flange that the brake drum is bolted. The splined inner end carries a rubber cushioned coupling to which the drive shaft flange is attached. 
7:2 Removal of rear suspension assembly 
1 Jack-up the vehicle and place on firmly based stands. Remove the road wheel on the side from which the suspension unit is to be removed. 
2 Using a garage hydraulic jack support the swinging arm to facilitate the removal of the upper shock absorber mounting nut which is located inside the vehicle on the floor. To gain access to the nut remove the rear wheel housing linings. 
3 Unhook the parking brake shoe control lever return spring. 
4 Remove the three screws securing the drive shaft flange to the flexible coupling. Pull back the sleeve and remove the inner spring. 
5 Remove the brake fluid reservoir cap, remove the filter and plug the delivery hole in the brake fluid reservoir and disconnect the flexible brake pipe from the bracket on the body floor. 
6 Disconnect the parking brake control tie rod by first removing the cotter pin and removing the cable eye from the pin on the shoe control lever. Release the cable adjustment nuts and free the cable from the fairlead on the swinging arm. 
7 Using the hydraulic jack carefully lower the swinging arm, fully retract the shock absorber by pushing in the outer cylinder and carefully pull out the coil spring together with its mounting rubber rings. 
8 Remove the self-locking nut securing the swinging arm to the internal support welded on the floor. Extract the mounting pin and note the number and arrangement of shims between the bushings and the bracket. This will facilitate reassembly.

7:3 Servicing swing arms 
Dismantling: 
1 Remove the cotter pin and release the nut fixing the flexible joint to the wheel shaft. Remove the plain 
washer and the joint. 
2 Using Fiat tool A.40005.1.9 or a universal two-leg puller, remove the wheel shaft and brake drum. 
Extract the two oil seals and both the outer and inner 
bearing inner rings, thrust ring of the joint and the 
resilient spacer. 
3 Using Fiat tool A.6511, remove the two bearing outer rings. 
4 Disconnect the brake hydraulic line at the wheel cylinder and remove the swinging external support. 
The bearing housing and brake housing flange may 
then be removed. 
Inspection : 
Thoroughly clean all the parts and install the swinging 
arm on Fiat fixture A.66064 as shown in FIG 7:4. If the 80 
Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine
swinging arm has not been distorted its installation on the fixture should be straightforward. Tighten the clamp screws 1 (see FIG 7:3) on the road wheel brake drum, connect the swinging arm inner member to the seating 2 on the fixture and finally fit the swinging arm external support holes on the fixture pins 3. Should difficulty be experienced in either one of these three operations then this is an indication that the swinging arm is distorted and should be straightened or a new assembly fitted. If this check is satisfactory proceed as follows: 
1 Check that the 'estendblocks' are a snug fit in their respective seatings in the swinging arm and that the mounting pin slides in freely without excessive play. To renew the 'estendblocks' use Fiat tool A.66056 which is suitable for both their removal and installation. 
2 Check that the inner and outer bearing outer rings have no play in their seatings and that the rollers and cages are not broken, cracked, show signs of overheating or are worn. 
3 Ensure that the oil seals fit snugly on the wheel shaft, also on the joint spacer or shoulder ring and on the hub seats. If the oil seals should show any signs of wear then these should be renewed. 
4 Inspect the resilient spacer for signs of hair line cracks, which if not evident the spacer may be used again as it is not permanently distorted during assembly. Should, however, new bearings or bearing housings be fitted it is considered good practice to fit a new spacer. 

FIG 7 :2 Right rear suspension assembly, sectioned through brake drum and arm mountings 

5 Check the mating surface of the bearing inner rings on the wheel shaft and ensure that it is perfectly smooth. Also check that the shaft splines to flexible joint splines are not distorted or show signs of excess wear. The maximum permissible wear backlash is .0059 inch. 
6 Ensure that the flexible joint is not damaged where the rubber is bonded to the metal. If signs of strain are indicated a new joint must be fitted. 
Reassembly: 
Reassembly of the swinging arm unit is the reverse procedure to dismantling. The following points should be noted: 
1 Always use Fiat tool A.66056 to install 'estendblock' on the swing arm. 
2 The mounting nuts for the bearing housing to the brake housing flange should always be tightened to a

4 If the axle shaft to flexible joint tie sleeve has been removed, the mating splines must be coated with Fiat B2G grease on re-installation. 
5 Preload the wheel bearings and adjust the swinging arm as described later on in this section. 
Wheel bearing adjustment: 
To ensure a long bearing life due to correct initial adjustment the ballbearings should be preloaded and to do this proceed as follows: 
1 Tighten the wheel shaft nut gradually so that the rotation torque does not exceed .36 Ib/ft. 
2 To check the rotation torque install Fiat tool A.95697/2 on the wheel drum and insert the shank 2 (see FIG 7:5) of dynomometer A.95697 in the support and securely hold the lever 3. Move the needle 5 to register .36 Ib/ft on the dynomometer scale as shown in FIG 7:5 and using the operating lever 6 rotate the dyno mometer and the wheel shaft some turns in a clockwise direction. During rotation check that the needle 5 does not exceed the setting index 4. Should the rotation torque prove to exceed .36 Ib/ft, this will indicate a

high bearing preload. To reset remove the wheel shaft and fit a new resilient spacer. Repeat the rotation torque test. 
Swinging arm adjustment: 
To adjust the swinging arm use Fiat fixture A.66064 as shown in FIG 7:3 and proceed as follows: 1 At points A and B as indicated in FIG 7 : 4 between the 
'estendblock' and the swinging arm to body front mounting bracket fit three shims on each side. To ensure that the shims are correctly centred use Fiat alignment bar A.66057. 
2 Whilst removing the alignment bar, carefully slip in the mounting pin and screw on the nut. Once the rear wheel geometry adjustment has been completed this nut should be tightened to a torque wrench setting of 43.4 to 50.6 Ib ft. 
3 At points C and D (see FIG 7:4), insert the number of shims required to fill in the gap between the 'estend block' and the two fixture shoulders. Having deter mined the number of shims required both at locations C and D, these must later be fitted between the 'estendblock' and the shoulders on the swinging arm to body mounting bracket. 
7:4 Coil springs 
The coil springs should be thoroughly cleaned and all traces of rust removed. Inspect the spring coils for hair line cracks, which if evident, a new pair of springs must be fitted to ensure correct vehicle height and stability. Check the free height and the height under loading of the coil springs and these must correspond to the figures quoted in Technical Data. 
7:5 Installation of rear suspension assembly 
To replace the rear suspension assembly proceed as follows: 
1 Insert the swinging arm inner end in the mounting bracket which is welded onto the body floor. Place between the 'estendblock' and bracket the number of adjustment shims as previously determined using Fiat fixture A.66064 as shown in FIG 7:4. Insert the Fiat alignment bar A.66057 through 'estendblock' and shims, aligning them with the holes in the mounting bracket. Firmly hold the entire assembly using a garage hydraulic jack if necessary, and carefully remove the alignment bar and at the same time ease in the mounting pin. Secure the nut which once the rear wheels geometry has been checked must be tightened to a torque wrench setting of 43.4 to 50.6 Ib/ft. 
2 Screw in finger tight the three swinging arm external bracket to body floor mounting screws together with the plain and spring washers. The screws will have to be tightened to a torque wrench setting of 28.9 to 36.2 Ib/ft once the rear wheel geometry has been adjusted. 
3 Carefully insert the coil spring, lower insulator ring onto the swinging arm, insert the spring on the shock absorber which should be previously secured to the arm and position the spring onto its seat on the arm. Place the upper insulator ring onto the spring, raise the suspension assembly using a garage hydraulic jack and insert the spring onto its seating under the body floor. 
FIG 7:7 Adjusting rear wheel toe-in angle 
Key to Fig 7:7 Rear wheel plane must be perpendicular to ground and parallel to car longitudinal centerline with a tolerance of 0° 10' 
To adjust rear wheel geometry, move suitably the swinging arm outer support. Slight movements are permitted by the play existing between the support holes A and the mounting screws. Screws B must be tightened to 28.9 to 36.2 Ibft (4000 to 5000 kg mm). Nuts C must be tightened to 43.4 to 50.6 Ib ft (6000 to 7000 kgmm), after adjustment has been carried out. (These directions and specifications are also applicable to 500 Station Wagon).

7 Reconnect the parking brake tie rod and adjust the position of the cable using the two stretchers. 8 Refit the wheels and draw up the mounting screws to a torque wrench setting of 32.5 to 39.8 Ib/ft. Carefully lower the vehicle to the floor. 
7 :6 Checking and adjusting rear wheel toe-in 
This check should be carried out by a Fiat agent as special setting equipment is necessary. However, details of this check are given for reference purposes: 
To check and adjust the rear wheel geometry proceed as follows: 
1 Place the vehicle on firmly based stands and remove the front and rear wheels. 
2 Install Fiat fixtures A.66062 as shown in FIG 7:12 to enable correct spring compression and wheel location in the vertical position. 
3 Lift the rear suspensions by compressing the coil springs and shock absorbers using garage hydraulic jacks. Screw on the fixture lower shank until the index registers with the mark 'Nuova 500' stamped on the bracket. In this position the wheel plane is vertical and the centre O (see FIG 7:6) of wheel shaft results at 5.00 inch from the buffer stop bracket. 

NOTE -- that the toe-in angle 
will vary by 0° 10' under 
4 Secure Fiat support C.696/3 to the wheel drum and 

a movement of some 7/32 inch measured at 72.476 inch from wheel centre for Model 500D, and at 76.413 inch from wheel centre for 500 Station Wagon 
connect gauge C.696 to the support. Tighten the two clamping screws as shown in FIG 7:12. 
5 Apply at the front of Fiat gauge C.696 bracket numbered C.696/3 as shown in FIG 7:11. 
6 Check that the pin mounted on the front end of the bracket C.696/3 is in touch with the front suspension swinging arm pin (see FIG 7:11). If these conditions are not complied with, proceed with item 7.

A tolerance of —10'.+ 15' is permitted providing 
that the value is the same for both rear wheels. It is 
important that both rear wheels are set to the same 
angle otherwise uneven tyre wear and adverse handl 
ing conditions will result. When the wheel is parallel to 
the centre line of the vehicle the pin of bracket 
C.696/3 will be .216 inch apart from the pin of the 
front suspension swinging arm. 
7 Release the swinging arm outer support to body 
mounting screws and position arm in such a way as to 
obtain the condition as described in Number 6 above. 
After the adjustment has been completed tighten 
the outer support mounting screws to a torque wrench 
setting of 28.9 to 36.2 Ib/ft. Also tighten the two 
swinging arm pin nuts C (see FIG 7:7) to a torque 
wrench setting of 43.4 to 50.6 Ib/ft. Take off the gauge 
C.696 with bracket and support C.696/3, and repeat 
the check and adjustment operations on the other 
wheel. Care must be taken to ensure that bracket 
C.696/3 is reversed from the position previously used. 
New 500 type 500D, 110F and 110L sedan and 
station wagon: 
After the rear suspension has been replaced, check 
and, if necessary adjust the rear wheel geometry. 
1 Inflate the tyres to the normal operating pressures. 
2 Lower the car body so that the rear wheels are set at 
90 deg. to the floor. This condition is obtained when 
the lowermost portion of the sump is 6.61 inches from 
the floor level for the new 500D model or the centre 
rear bracket for jacking up the rear of the vehicle 
8.9 inches from the floor level for the 500 Station 
Wagon. 
3 With the vehicle set to the above conditions check the 
wheel geometry. The wheel plane must converge with 
the centre line of the vehicle by an angle of 0 deg. 10' 
(—10', +15') toeing in at the front. 
4 The wheel plane must be 22.343 ± .059 inches from 
the centre line of the vehicle for the 500D model. 
Whereas for the 500 Station Wagon the distance must 
be 22.264 ± .059 inches.

8:1 Description 
The independent front suspension assembly fitted to the 'new 500' range comprises a transverse leaf spring which is anchored to the body through two rubber mountings and kingpins through 'estendblocks' as shown in FIG 8 : 1 . The leaf spring also acts as an anti roll bar which gives normal spring reaction even when the front road wheels encounter a rough road surface. 
Special polyethylene insulating strips are fitted between the five springs leaves which are all clamped together by two rubber cushioned clamps. 
Upper movement of the kingpins in the swinging arm is obtained by 'estendblocks'. The half arms are anchored to the body as shown in FIG 8:3 and pivot on their pins through rubber bushes. Double acting hydraulic shock absorbers are fitted to the kingpin housings at the lower end and anchored at the top to the vehicle body. Two rubber buffers are secured to brackets mounted onto the body to limit the spring oscillations. The spring centre bolt is also fitted with a rubber pad. 
8:2 Front suspension removal and dismantling 
To remove the front suspension assembly proceed as follows: 
1 Remove the hub caps and carefully slacken the road wheel retaining bolts. Using a garage hydraulic jack raise the front of the vehicle and place on firmly based stands. Remove the road wheels. 
2 Disconnect the steering linkages from the pitman arm, the drag link and the steering knuckle arms. 
3 Remove the shock absorber upper mounting nut from the body, lift away the half rubber bush and push down the outer cylinder. 
4 Blank off the brake fluid reservoir outlet by inserting a suitable wooden peg through the reservoir filler opening and disconnect the brake hydraulic lines at the wheel cylinders. 
5 Fit Fiat crossbeam Arr.2072 under the leaf spring and support this, using a garage hydraulic jack. 6 Remove the self-locking nut securing the leaf spring to the kingpin housing and ease out the spring mounting bolt taking care not to damage the thread. Also remove the nuts securing the swinging arm pin to studs on the body and remove the swinging arm assembly. Carefully lift out the adjusting shims and spacers from the studs making a careful note of the number of the shims and their locations.
